          Put people at the heart of everything you do
        </h2>
        <p>Patients, family, carers, staff. Design things that understand and respect people's needs. Take the time to learn about the whole person - their emotional, physical and technical needs.</p>
        <p>Design with compassion.</p>
      </div>

          Design for the outcome
        </h2>
        <p>What will good look like? What are the health, wellbeing or other measurable outcomes that your work will impact? Your work should improve lives, either directly or indirectly.</p>
      </div>
    </li>

          Be inclusive
        </h2>
        <p>NHS services are for everyone. Make sure people with different physical, mental health, social, cultural or learning needs can use your design.</p>

          Design for context
        </h2>
        <p>Don't just design your part of a service. Consider people's entire experience, and the infrastructure and processes involved. Think about how people begin and end their time with what you are designing.</p>
      </div>
    </li>

          Design for trust
        </h2>
        <p>People trust the NHS. Take care not to jeopardise that. Design things that are reliable and secure.</p>

          Test your assumptions
        </h2>
        <p>Design and test your work with real people. Observe behaviour and gather evidence. Work with subject experts and existing research. Do not rely on hunches.</p>
      </div>
    </li>

    <li class="featured-item">

          Make, learn, iterate
        </h2>
        <p>Start small. Experiment with different ways of doing things. Make prototypes to improve your understanding. Test and refine.</p>
      </div>
    </li>

          Do the hard work to make it simple
        </h2>
        <p>Healthcare journeys can be complex. Take the time to understand what you are trying to solve. Do not push complexity onto the people using what you are designing.</p>
      </div>
    </li>

      <li class="featured-item">

          Make things open. It makes things better
        </h2>
        <p>Share your learning. Share your work. Be transparent in your design decisions.</p>
