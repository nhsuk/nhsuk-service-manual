    <h2>What we're working on next</h2>
    <p>We've started with <a href="">accessibility</a> because teams tell us it's a very important area for them. We'll be researching and testing more detailed accessibility guidance over the next couple of months.</p>
    <p>We're also starting work on guidance on agile working and will be looking at what user researchers need from the service manual.</p>
    <p>Please get in touch on the <a href="#">NHS.UK #standards Slack channel</a> if you'd like to contribute or email the standards team at <a href="#">service-manual@nhs.net</a>.</p>
