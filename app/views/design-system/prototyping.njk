  <h2 id="before-you-start">Before you start</h2>
  <p>To make prototypes you will need to install the <a href="https://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs">NHS.UK prototype kit</a> which has been built to work with the service manual.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-guides">How to guides</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs/how-tos">how to guides</a> will show you how to use the prototype kit, from creating pages to building complex user journeys. Including guidance on passing data page to page, branching, setting up Git and publishing a prototype to the web.</p>

  <h2 id="styling-page-elements">Styling page elements</h2>
  <p>The service manual provides lots of new CSS classes for styling page elements, so you should not need to write as much of your own Sass or CSS.</p>
  <p>Explore the <a href="/design-system/styles/">Styles</a> section of the service manual to see what classes are available and how to apply them.</p>

  <h2 id="using-components">Using components</h2>
  <p><a href="/design-system/components/">Components</a> are reusable parts of the user interface, like buttons, text inputs and checkboxes. The components in the service manual are designed to be accessible and responsive.</p>
  <p>There are 2 ways to use components in the service manual. You can either use HTML or a Nunjucks macro.</p>
  <p>You can copy the code from the HTML or Nunjucks tabs below the examples on our component pages, like this example of a button.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "buttons",
    type: "default"
  }) }}

  <h2 id="using-nunjucks-macros">Using Nunjucks macros</h2>
  <p>A Nunjucks macro is a simple template that generates more complex HTML. However, macros are more sensitive to mistakes than HTML, so itâ€™s worth saving and previewing.</p>
  <p>When using Nunjucks macros in the prototype kit leave out the first line that starts with <code>{% raw %}{% from ...{% endraw %}</code>.</p>
