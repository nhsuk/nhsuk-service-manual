<p>NHS England has a licence for 3 weights of the Frutiger font, which is the brand font for the NHS. Monotype owns the font software and other elements of the font which are protected by intellectual property rights. We call these the "font" for short in these terms.</p>
<h2>Who can register for a sub-licence</h2>
<p>NHS organisations in England can register to use the font for free under a "sub-licence". You must sign up to the terms on this page to get a sub-licence.</p>
<p>[Insert para about legally-binding versus non-legally binding agreements.]</p>
<p>You do not need to register if your team is part of NHS England.</p>

<h2>The fonts covered</h2>
<p>The sub-licence covers Frutiger in 3 weights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Frutiger 65 Bold</li>
  <li>Frutiger 55 Roman</li>
  <li>Frutiger 45 Light, but the licence does not cover using this weight in an app</li>
</ul>
<p>The sub-licence covers the font version and format that NHS England bought in December 2024. It does not cover later versions or formats (such as variable fonts, which are fonts that use 1 file to store many font styles).</p>

<h3>Other Frutiger fonts</h3>
<p>You must buy your own licence if you want to use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>any other font or font weight, such as Frutiger Italic</li>
  <li>Frutiger 45 Light in a mobile downloadable app</li>
  <li>Frutiger in a way that is not covered in the sub-licence</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a licence for other Frutiger fonts, you must follow the terms of those licences.</p>


<h2>What you can and cannot do with a sub-licence</h2>
<p>You must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>manage access to the font and only let people in your organisation or your suppliers use it for your organisation's purposes â€“ there's no limit to the number of people who can use it</li>
  <li>make sure everyone you allow to use the font is aware of and agrees to these terms</li>
  <li>only use the font for the purposes and use cases set out in these terms</li>
</ul>
<p>You are responsible for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your users' and suppliers' use of the fonts and compliance with your sub-licence</li>
    <li>any unauthorised access to the font on your or their systems</li>
    <li>any claims by Monotype for your, your users' and your suppliers' misuse of the font</li>
  </ul>
<p>You must not sub-licence, assign or transfer the font to another organisation or give anyone outside your organisation access to it, with the exception of your suppliers who are using it for your organisation's purposes. They must not grant any further sub-licences.</p>
<p>NHS England is not responsible for any losses, claims or liabilities arising out of your, your users' or suppliers' use of the font on your or their systems.</p>
<p>You cannot use Monotype's font platform or its app to get these fonts. You can only get them by registering here.</p>
<h3>Suppliers</h3>

<p>You must make sure that they:</p>
<ul>
  <li>agree to these terms</li>
  <li>only use the font to provide goods or services to you</li>
  <li>do not allow anyone else to use the font</li>
  <li>delete any font files you have given them at the end of the job</li>
</ul>
<h3>The font files</h3>
<p>You must not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>change the font or use it to make other fonts</li>
  <li>embed the font software code in open source software in a way that makes it publicly available</li>
