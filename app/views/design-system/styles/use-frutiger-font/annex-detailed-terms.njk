  <h3>4. CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>

  <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
    <li>
        <p>The NHS Partner, when receiving Confidential Information, must, for a period of three (3) years from date of receipt of the Confidential Information:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>keep all Confidential Information it receives confidential and secure;</li>
            <li>not disclose, use, or exploit the Confidential Information without NHSE's prior written consent (which the NHS Partner acknowledges is subject to NHSE obtaining Monotype's consent), except for the purposes anticipated under this Agreement; and</li>
            <li>immediately notify NHSE if it suspects unauthorised access, copying, use, or disclosure of the Confidential Information</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>In spite of Section 4A, the NHS Partner may disclose Confidential Information in any of the following instances:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>where disclosure is required by applicable law, a regulatory body, or a court with the relevant jurisdiction, if permitted and possible, the NHS Partner notifies NHSE in writing in advance of the full circumstances, the affected Confidential Information, and the extent of the disclosure;</li>
            <li>if the NHS Partner already had the information without obligation of confidentiality before it was disclosed, directly or indirectly, under or in connection with this Agreement;</li>
            <li>if the information was given to it by a third party without obligation of confidentiality;</li>
            <li>if the information was in the public domain at the time of the disclosure;</li>
            <li>if the information was independently developed without access to Monotype's Confidential Information;</li>
            <li>on a confidential basis, to its auditors or for the purpose of regulatory requirement;</li>
            <li>on a confidential basis, to its professional advisers on a need-to-know basis; and</li>
            <li>to the Serious Fraud Office where the NHS Partner has reasonable grounds to believe that Monotype is involved in activity that may be a criminal offence under the Bribery Act 2010;</li>
            <li>on a confidential basis to the Sublicensees and any other employees, agents, consultants, and contractors of the NHS Partner;</li>
            <li>if the NHS Partner (acting reasonably) considers disclosure necessary or appropriate to carry out its public functions;</li>
            <li>where requested by Parliament; or</li>
            <li>on a confidential basis for audit purposes</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>For the purposes of Section 4B above, references to disclosure on a confidential basis mean disclosure under a confidentiality agreement or arrangement including terms as strict as those required in this Section 4.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>NHSE is subject to the requirements of the FOIA and the EIRs. Monotype has acknowledged in its licence with NHSE that NHSE and NHS Partners may be required under the FOIA and EIRs to disclose information (including confidential information) without consulting or obtaining consent from Monotype, and that NHSE shall take reasonable steps to notify Monotype of a Request for Information (in accordance with the Secretary of State's section 45 Code of Practice on the Discharge of the Functions of Public Authorities under Part 1 of the FOIA) to the extent that it is permissible and reasonably practical for it to do so. The NHS Partner must assist NHSE in meeting this obligation, and shall notify NHSE of, and cooperate and assist NHSE in respect of, any Request for Information relating to Monotype's Confidential Information, including as set out in Section 4E or 4F, as applicable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Where the NHS Partner <strong>is</strong> subject to the requirements of the FOIA and the EIRs, the Parties shall cooperate and assist one another so as to enable them to meet their respective obligations under the FOIA and the EIRs. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, where a party (the "<strong>Recipient</strong>") receives a request for information which is covered by the FOIA and the EIRs and which relates to the other party's or Monotype's information ("<strong>Requested Information</strong>"), the parties shall comply with the following procedures:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>the Recipient shall, before making any disclosure of the Requested Information and as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving the request, notify the other party of the receipt of such request and of the nature and extent of the information covered by the request;</li>
            <li>following notification under (i), the other party (and, if required by NHSE, Monotype) may make representations to the Recipient as to whether and on what basis the Requested Information is covered by any exemption in the FOIA and the EIRs and should not therefore be disclosed, including, where relevant, the balance of the public interests in disclosure and non-disclosure ("<strong>Representations</strong>");</li>
            <li>the Recipient shall reasonably consider any Representations before reaching a determination on whether it is obliged to disclose the Requested Information. However, the parties acknowledge that in all cases it is for the Recipient (having full regard to any applicable guidance or codes issued by the Information Commissioner) to determine whether it is obliged to disclose the Requested Information under the FOIA and the EIRs, including where the public interest lies in relation to the disclosure; and</li>
            <li>if the Recipient determines that it is obliged to disclose the Requested Information, it shall notify the other party reasonably in advance of disclosure being made</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Where the NHS Partner <strong>is not</strong> subject to the requirements of the FOIA and the EIRs, the NHS Partner shall:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>provide all necessary assistance and cooperation as reasonably requested by NHSE to enable NHSE to comply with its obligations under the FOIA and EIRs; and</li>
            <li>not respond directly to a Request for Information addressed to an NHS Partner unless authorised in writing to do so by NHSE.</li>
        </ol>
       <p>The NHS Partner acknowledges that NHSE may be required under the FOIA and EIRs to disclose information (including confidential information) without consulting or obtaining the NHS Partner's consent, NHSE shall take reasonable steps to notify the NHS Partner of a Request for Information (in accordance with the Secretary of State's section 45 Code of Practice on the Discharge of the Functions of Public Authorities under Part 1 of the FOIA) to the extent that it is permissible and reasonably practical for it to do so but (notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement) NHSE shall be responsible for determining in its absolute discretion whether any confidential information or any other information is exempt from disclosure in accordance with the FOIA and EIRs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Subject to Sections 4B(i), 4B(vi) to 4B(xii), 4D, 4E and 4F, the NHS Partner must not share or disclose the link to this Annex or the terms of this Annex without NHSE's prior written consent.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>5. TERMINATION</h3>

  <p>NHSE may suspend and/or terminate this Agreement and the NHS Partner's licences and rights under it upon sixty (60) days' prior written notice to the NHS Partner if the NHS Partner or its Sublicensee has materially breached this Agreement in any way, where such material breach has not been cured within that sixty (60) day period. Any such notice shall set forth the material breach or material breaches and the actions necessary to cure them, if a cure is possible. Under this paragraph:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
    <li>a breach will be considered "material" if it deprives a party of the substantial benefit of a key clause or obligation in question; and</li>
    <li>any material breach by the NHS Partner of Section 2 (Licence Grants) shall be deemed remedied only if the relevant NHS Partner satisfies NHSE (acting reasonably) that such material breach or breaches have been cured</li>
</ul>
  <p>In addition to the above, where, in NHSE's reasonable opinion, the actions of the NHS Partner or any Sublicensee are likely to:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
      <li>result in a breach of this Agreement;</li>
      <li>cause NHSE to be in breach of their agreement with Monotype;</li>
      <li>result in reputational damage to NHSE; or</li>
      <li>result in a claim being brought against NHSE by Monotype,</li>
  </ul>
  <p>NHSE may suspend, revoke, and/or terminate this licence and any or all rights granted under this Agreement.</p>
  <p>In the event of termination, revocation, or suspension, all rights and licences granted under or in connection with this Agreement to the NHS Partner (including any rights or licences granted by NHSE or the NHS Partner to the Sublicensees) shall automatically terminate (or, respectively, be revoked or suspended).</p>
  <p>The termination of this Agreement shall not preclude NHSE from pursuing (to the extent permitted by law) the NHS Partner for damages of any breach of the Agreement.</p>

  <h3>6. WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>

            <li>the Font Software is not Publicly Available Software</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The NHS Partner must notify NHSE promptly in writing of any claim, permit NHSE (or anyone nominated by NHSE) to control the defence or settlement, and cooperate fully with NHSE and anyone else nominated by NHSE (at the NHS Partner's cost).</p>

            <li>any damages caused by the NHS Partner's or Sublicensees' failure to adhere to this Agreement</li>
