  <p>WCAG 2.2: Make sure that users can successfully <a href="#wcag-icon-focus">interact with icons used as buttons</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="icons">Icons you can use</h2>
  <p>Use these icons to mark important parts of the page and highlight things you want users to do.</p>
  <p>Check the relevant component and pattern pages in the design system for guidance on how to use the icons, including use of colour.</p>

  <h3 id="arrows">Left and right arrows</h3>
  <p>The left and right arrow icons are used in the <a href="/design-system/components/pagination">pagination</a> component. These icons should be used alongside text labels, for example "Previous page" and "Next page".</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "arrows"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="arrow-right-circle">Right arrow (inside a circle)</h3>
  <p>The right arrow inside a circle icon is used in the <a href="/design-system/components/action-link">action link</a> component. This icon should be used to signpost links that start a digital service.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "arrow-right-circle"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="chevron-right-circle">Right chevron (inside a circle)</h3>
  <p>The right chevron inside a circle icon is used in the <a href="/design-system/components/card#primary-card-with-chevron">primary card</a> component. This icon should be used on hub page cards to signpost important groups of information.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "chevron-right-circle"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="tick-and-cross">Tick and cross</h3>
  <p>The tick (do) and cross (don't) icons are used for <a href="/design-system/components/do-and-dont-lists">do and don't lists</a>. These icons should be shown below "Do" and "Don't" headings.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "tick-and-cross"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="search">Search</h3>
  <p>The search icon is used in the <a href="/design-system/components/header">header</a> component. When used without a visible text label, make sure the icon has an accessible name, for example "Search".</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "search"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="user">User profile</h3>
  <p>The user profile icon is used in the <a href="/design-system/components/header">header</a> component. This icon should be shown alongside information about the currently logged-in user.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "user"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="plus-and-minus">Plus and minus</h3>
  <p>We use plus (+) and minus (-) in the <a href="/design-system/components/expander">expander</a> component. However, these are provided by the CSS. We do not have SVG icons for them.</p>

  <h3 id="british-sign-language">British Sign Language (BSL)</h3>
  <p>We also have BSL icons you can download to help users recognise that information is available in BSL. See the <a href="/design-system/patterns/find-bsl-content">Find BSL content pattern</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="how-to-use-these-icons">How to use these icons</h2>
  <p>Use icons sparingly, and not for decoration.</p>

  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-icon-focus" role="note">
    <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">
      WCAG 2.2
    </strong>

    <p>Make sure any icons used as buttons are at least 24px by 24px in target size, or that there is another way to perform the action. For example: a search icon to submit a query supported by a labelled "Search" button.</p>
    <p>This is to make sure users can easily interact with them. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.5.8 Target Size (W3C)</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Using SVG classes for icons</h3>
  <p>We use scalable vector graphics (SVG) for icons, rather than images such as PNG. SVG are code snippets that you can drop directly into the HTML.</p>
  <p>SVG icons are sharp, flexible, and load quickly. You can control how they appear, for example their colour, with style sheets (CSS).</p>
  <p>If you're using Nunjucks templating language, you can use the <code>nhsukIcon</code> macro.</p>
  <p>SVG icons have the class <code>.nhsuk-icon</code>, which sets a default size for the icon. Each icon also has a specific class, such as <code>.nhsuk-icon--search</code>. The specific class allows you to modify the icon with styles, such as colour via <code>fill</code>.</p>

  <h3>Using colour with icons</h3>
  <p>Icons often need to change colour based on their context and state, such as hover, focus and active. When choosing colours, make sure they have sufficient colour contrast to pass <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (W3C)</a>.</p>

  <h3>Changing the size of an icon</h3>
  <p>If you want to make an icon bigger, you can use the size override classes to make an icon 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% larger.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "sizes"
  }) }}

  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
  <p>SVG icons must be accessible. For example, they need to meet accessible colour contrast standards. Our recommended tool to test colour combinations is the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM contrast checker</a>. Read more about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/">accessible SVGs on CSS Tricks website</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
  <p>These icons seem to be universally recognisable. When we tested them, we found that people understood them. We tested them in context â€“ not on their own, but in components on a full page.</p>
