  <p>WCAG 2.2: Make sure that users can successfully <a href="#wcag-icon-focus">interact with icons used as buttons</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="icons">Icons you can use</h2>
  <p>Use these icons to mark important parts of the page and highlight things you want users to do.</p>

  <h3 id="arrows">Left and right arrows</h3>
  <p>The left and right arrow icons are used in the <a href="/design-system/components/pagination">pagination</a> component. These icons should be used alongside text labels, for example ‘Previous page’ and ‘Next page’.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "arrows"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="arrow-right-circle">Right arrow (inside a circle)</h3>
  <p>The right arrow inside a circle icon is used in the <a href="/design-system/components/action-link">action link</a> and primary <a href="/design-system/components/card">card</a> components. This icon should be used to add visual weight and signpost key links on a page.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "arrow-right-circle"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="tick-and-cross">Tick and cross</h3>
  <p>The tick (do) and cross (don't) icons are used for <a href="/design-system/components/do-and-dont-lists">do and don't lists</a>. These icons should be shown below 'Do' and 'Don't' headings.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "tick-and-cross"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="search">Search</h3>
  <p>The search icon is used in the <a href="/design-system/components/header">header</a> component. When used without a visible text label, make sure the icon has an accessible name, for example 'Search'.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "search"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="user">User profile</h3>
  <p>The user profile icon is used in the <a href="/design-system/components/header">header</a> component. This icon should be shown alongside information about the currently logged in user.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "user"
  }) }}

  <h2 id="how-to-use-these-icons">How to use these icons</h2>
  <p>Use icons sparingly, and not for decoration.</p>

  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-icon-focus" role="note">
    <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">
      WCAG 2.2
    </strong>

    <p>Make sure any icons used as buttons are at least 24px by 24px in target size, or that there is another way to perform the action. For example: a search icon to submit a query supported by a labelled "Search" button.</p>
    <p>This is to make sure users can easily interact with them. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.5.8 Target Size (W3C)</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Using SVG classes for icons</h3>
  <p>We use scalable vector graphics (SVG) for icons, rather than images such as PNG. SVG are code snippets that you can drop directly into the HTML.</p>
  <p>SVG icons are sharp, flexible, and load quickly. You can control how they appear, for example their colour, with style sheets (CSS).</p>
  <p>If you're using Nunjucks templating language, you can use the <code>nhsukIcon</code> macro.</p>
  <p>SVG icons have the class <code>.nhsuk-icon</code>, which sets a default size for the icon. Each icon also has a specific class, such as <code>.nhsuk-icon--search</code>. The specific class allows you to modify the icon with styles, such as colour via <code>fill</code>.</p>

  <h3>Using colour with icons</h3>
  <p>Icons often need to change colour based on their context and state, such as hover, focus and active. Make sure that when choosing icon colours, they have sufficient colour contrast to pass <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (W3C)</a>.</p>

  <h3>Changing the size of an icon</h3>
  <p>If you want to make an icon bigger, you can use the size override classes to make an icon 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% larger.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "styles",
    item: "icons",
    type: "sizes"
  }) }}

  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
  <p>SVG icons must be accessible. For example, they need to meet accessible colour contrast standards. Our recommended tool to test colour combinations is the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM contrast checker</a>.

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
  <p>These icons seem to be universally recognisable. When we tested them, we found that people understood them. We tested them in context – not on their own, but in components on a full page.</p>
