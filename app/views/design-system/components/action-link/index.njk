  <h2>When to use action links </h2>
  <p>Use action links to signpost the start of a digital service.</p>

  <h2>When not to use action links</h2>
  <p>Do not use action links in forms. Use a <a href="/design-system/components/buttons">button</a> instead.</p>
  <p>We don't use action links just to link to another page or site. If you need a link to stand out, you can use <a href="/design-system/components/inset-text">inset text</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use-action-links">How to use action links</h2>
  <p>Keep the words on the action link short. Start with a verb, for example: "Book an appointment" or "Apply for an EHIC card".</p>
  <p>Action links usually sit in a block of text. You can also put one in a care card. (Find out more about <a href="/design-system/patterns/help-users-decide-when-and-where-to-get-care">helping users decide when and where to get care, with care cards</a>.)</p>
  <p>You can have more than one action link on a page but avoid putting them near each other.</p>
  <p>The link colour and background colour contrast ratio is 5.76:1, which passes AAA guidelines at that font size.</p>

  <h3 id="action-link-on-dark-backgrounds">Action link on dark backgrounds</h3>
  <p>Use the <code>nhsuk-action-link--reverse</code> modifier class to show white links and arrows on dark backgrounds – for example, in custom components and patterns with darker backgrounds.</p>
  <p>Make sure all users can see the action link – the background colour must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with white to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html">meet WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum), level AA</a>.</p>

  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
  <p>The link colour and background colour contrast ratio is 5.76:1, which passes AAA guidelines at that font size.</p>

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
  <p>We tested the action links on health information pages with lots of content, callout boxes and multi-page navigation.</p>
  <p>Users didn't notice early versions, so we made the size of the text larger than body text size.</p>
  <p>We used NHS blue first but users didn't notice it. So we changed the arrow colour to green - our "action" colour. Users seemed to see the green better.</p>
  <p>In follow-up tests on busy content pages, users pointed out the action links and said they found them useful.</p>
