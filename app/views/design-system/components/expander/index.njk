  <h2 id="when-to-use-this-component">When to use expanders</h2>
  <p>There are 2 ways to let users reveal more information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/details">details</a></li>
    <li>expander</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use expanders:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>on pages where users find the amount of information overwhelming - they break down information into bite size pieces which the user can "expand", when they're ready to do so</li>
    <li>for information for a wide audience, unlike the details component</li>
    <li>when you see a clear user need for them</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Test your content without an expander first. It may be better to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>simplify and reduce the amount of content</li>
    <li>split the content across multiple pages</li>
    <li>keep the content on a single page, separated by headings</li>
    <li>use a list of links to let users navigate quickly to specific sections of content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="when-not-to-use-this-component">When not to use an expander</h2>
  <p>Do not use an expander:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>if only some of your users will need the information - use <a href="/design-system/components/details">details</a> instead</li>
    <li>to give users help in forms - instead, add hint text as a part of other form inputs, such as <a href="/design-system/components/text-input#using-hint-text">text inputs</a>, <a href="/design-system/components/radios#radios-with-hints">radios</a> and <a href="/design-system/components/checkboxes#checkboxes-with-hint-text">checkboxes</a> or use details</li>
    <li>on pages with other interactive elements, such as <a href="/design-system/components/buttons">buttons</a> or <a href="/design-system/components/text-input">text input</a> - there's a risk that expanders will distract users</li>
    <li>inside other patterns, for example to <a href="/design-system/patterns/help-users-decide-when-and-where-to-get-care">help users decide when and where to get care (care cards)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-it-works">How expanders work</h2>
  <p>The expander is a short link in a box that expands into more detailed text when a user clicks on it.</p>

  <h3>More than 1 expander</h3>
  <p>It can work well to have several expanders. See the example below.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "expander",
    type: "group"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="write-clear-link-text">Write clear link text</h3>
  <p>Make the link text short and descriptive so users can quickly work out if they need to click on it.</p>

  <h2 id="research-on-this-component">Research</h2>
  <p>We tested several expanders in our information about type 1 diabetes where users felt overwhelmed by the amount of information. They tested well and seemed to meet users' emotional needs. We've also tested them on other pages about health and medicines.</p>
  <p>If you've used this component, get in touch to <a href="/community-and-contribution">share your user research findings</a>.</p>
