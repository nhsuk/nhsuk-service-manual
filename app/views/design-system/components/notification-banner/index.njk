<p>Use a notification banner to tell the user about something they need to know about, but that's not directly related to the page content.</p>

{# {{ example({ group: "components", item: "notification-banner", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s", loading: "eager" }) }} #}

<h2 id="when-to-use-this-component">When to use this component</h2>

<p>A notification banner lets you tell the user about something that's not directly relevant to the thing they're trying to do on that page of the service. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>telling the user about a problem that's affecting the service as a whole (for example, delays in processing applications because of an emergency)</li>
  <li>telling the user about something that affects them in particular (for example, an approaching deadline they need to meet)</li>
  <li>telling the user about the outcome of something they've just done on a previous page (for example, confirming that an email has been sent)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="when-not-to-use-this-component">When not to use this component</h2>

<p>Use notification banners sparingly. There's <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/">evidence that people often miss them</a>, and using them too often is likely to make this problem worse.</p>

<p>If the information is directly relevant to the thing the user is doing on that page, put the information in the main page content instead. Use an <a href="/design-system/components/inset-text/">Inset text component</a> or <a href="/design-system/components/warning-callout/">Warning callout</a> if it needs to stand out.</p>

<p>Do not:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a notification banner to tell the user about validation errors - use an <a href="/design-system/components/error-message/">Error message component</a> and <a href="/design-system/components/error-summary/">Error summary component</a> instead</li>
<li>show a notification banner and an <a href="/design-system/components/error-summary/">Error summary component</a> on the same page - just show the error summary</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>Position a notification banner immediately before the page <code>h1</code>. The notification banner should be the same width as the page's other content, such as components, headings and body text. For example, if the other content takes up two-thirds of the screen on desktop devices, then the notification banner should also take up two-thirds. <a href="/design-system/styles/layout/">Read about how to lay out pages</a>.</p>

<p>Use <code>role="region"</code> and <code>aria-labelledby="nhsuk-notification-banner-title"</code> (with <code>id="nhsuk-notification-banner-title"</code> on <code>&lt;nhsuk-notification-banner__title&gt;</code>) so that screen reader users can navigate to the notification banner.</p>

<p>Avoid showing more than one notification banner on the same page. Instead, combine the messages in a single notification banner. If the messages are too different to combine, only show the highest priority notification banner.</p>

<h3 id="notification-banner-headings">Notification banner headings</h3>

<p>You can use <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> headings in the <code>nhsuk-notification-banner__content</code> to help structure your content.</p>

<p>Avoid using headings for single-line notifications that do not need them.</p>

<h2 id="telling-the-user-about-a-problem-that-affects-the-whole-service">Telling the user about a problem that affects the whole service</h2>

<p>Use a 'neutral' blue notification banner if the user needs to know about a problem with the service as a whole.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>in a service that lets the user register or apply for something, they might need to know that it's taking longer than usual to process applications because of an emergency</li>
<li>in an account-type service, the user might need to know that the service will be down for scheduled maintenance</li>
</ul>

{# {{ example({ group: "components", item: "notification-banner", example: "whole-service", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s" }) }} #}

<h2 id="telling-the-user-about-something-thats-happening-elsewhere">Telling the user about something that's happening elsewhere</h2>

<p>Use a 'neutral' notification banner if the user needs to know about something that's happening elsewhere in the service. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in a case working system, the user might need to know that there are new cases waiting for their attention</li>
  <li>in an account-type service, you might need to tell the user that there's a deadline approaching or that a payment is overdue</li>
</ul>

{# {{ example({ group: "components", item: "notification-banner", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s", titleSuffix: "second" }) }} #}

<h2 id="reacting-to-something-the-user-has-done">Reacting to something the user has done</h2>

<p>You can also use a notification banner to tell the user about the outcome of something they've just done - but they have not finished the current journey, so it does not make sense to use a <a href="/design-system/patterns/confirmation-page/">Confirmation page at this point in your service</a>.</p>

<p>Using a notification banner is unlikely to be the right approach in a linear service - for example, a service that lets the user register or apply for a thing. For a linear service, it will usually make sense to stick to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure">'one thing per page' approach</a>, and avoid using a notification banner.</p>

<p>Use a <a href="/design-system/patterns/confirmation-page/">Confirmation page in a linear service</a> to tell users that they've finished using the service instead of a notification banner.</p>

<p>Use the green version of the notification banner to confirm that something they're expecting to happen has happened.</p>

{# {{ example({ group: "components", item: "notification-banner", example: "success", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, size: "s" }) }} #}

<p>Since you're using the notification banner to tell the user about the outcome of something they've just done, add <code>role="alert"</code> so focus shifts to the notification banner on page load.</p>

<p>Remove a green notification banner when the user moves to a new page.</p>

<p>To make the green version of the notification banner accessible:</p>

<ul>
<li>use headings like 'Success' - so that you're not relying on colour alone to convey meaning – to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html">meet WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.1 Use of colour</a></li>
<li>use the same heading for green notification banners within the same service - so that you're identifying components that work in the same way consistently – this is to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-identification">meet WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.2.4 Consistent identification</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research-on-this-component">Research on this component</h2>

<p>We need more research to understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>how common it is for users to miss important information in notification banners (including users of assistive technology, who might skip straight to the <code>h1</code>)</li>
<li>whether it's sometimes helpful to allow users to dismiss notifications, and how to do this</li>
</ul>
