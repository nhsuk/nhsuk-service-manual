<h2 id="when-to-use-this-component">When to use this component</h2>

<p>A notification banner lets you tell the user about something that's not directly relevant to the thing they're trying to do on that page of the service.</p>

<p>There are 2 versions of the notification banner:</p>
<ul>
<li>a blue information banner</li>
<li>a green success banner</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the blue banner to tell the user information about:</p>

<ul>
<li>something that affects the service as a whole (such as delays in processing applications or planned downtime)</li>
<li>something that affects them in particular (for example, an approaching deadline they need to meet)</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the green banner to tell the user that something they've just done on a previous page was successful (for example, confirming that an email has been sent).</p>

<h2 id="when-not-to-use-this-component">When not to use this component</h2>

<p>Use notification banners sparingly. There's evidence that people often miss banners. Using them too often is likely to make this problem worse. See <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/banner-blindness-old-and-new-findings/">Banner blindness revisited by Norman Nielsen Group</a>.</p>

<p>Avoid showing more than 1 notification banner on the same page. Instead, combine the messages in a single notification banner. If the messages are too different to combine, only show the highest priority notification banner.</p>

<p>If the information is directly relevant to the thing the user is doing on that page, put the information in the main page content instead. Use an <a href="/design-system/components/inset-text/">inset text component</a> or <a href="/design-system/components/warning-callout/">warning callout</a> if it needs to stand out.</p>

<p>Do not use a notification banner to tell the user about validation errors. Use an <a href="/design-system/components/error-message/">error message component</a> and <a href="/design-system/components/error-summary/">error summary component</a> instead.</p>

<p>Do not show a notification banner and an <a href="/design-system/components/error-summary/">error summary component</a> on the same page. Just show the error summary.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>Put a notification banner immediately before the page <code>h1</code>. The notification banner should be the same width as the page's other content, such as components, headings and body text. For example, if the other content takes up two-thirds of the screen on desktop devices, then the notification banner should also take up two-thirds. <a href="/design-system/styles/layout/">Read about page layout</a>.</p>

<p>Use <code>role="region"</code> and <code>aria-labelledby="nhsuk-notification-banner-title"</code> (with <code>id="nhsuk-notification-banner-title"</code> on <code>&lt;nhsuk-notification-banner__title&gt;</code>) so that screen reader users can navigate to the notification banner.</p>

<h3 id="notification-banner-headings">Notification banner headings</h3>

<p>The notification banner starts with a heading "Important" or "Success". This is usually an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>If you need another heading, place it in <code>nhsuk-notification-banner__content</code>. It will normally be an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>. But avoid using another heading for single-line notifications that do not need them.</p>

<p>When you're not using a heading, you can style the text to stand out, for example, by applying the <code>nhsuk-notification-banner__heading</code> class to a paragraph.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-blue-information-banner">Using the blue notification banner</h2>

<p>Use a blue notification banner to give users information about something that affects the service as a whole.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>in a service that lets the user apply for something, they might need to know that it's taking longer than usual to process applications</li>
<li>in an account-type service, the user might need to know that the service will be down for scheduled maintenance</li>
</ul>

{{ designExample({
  group: "components",
  item: "notification-banner",
  type: "whole-service"
}) }}

<p>If your service is getting more demand than usual, check that youâ€™ve set up "There is a problem with the service" pages and "Service unavailable" pages, and the wording is up to date. Use the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/">patterns in the GOV.UK design system</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use the blue notification banner to tell users information about something that's happening elsewhere in the service. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>in a case working system, the user might need to know that there are new cases waiting for their attention</li>
  <li>in an account-type service, you might need to tell the user that there's a deadline approaching or that a payment is overdue</li>
</ul>

{{ designExample({
  group: "components",
  item: "notification-banner",
  type: "default"
}) }}

<h2 id="using-the-green-notification-banner">Using the green notification banner</h2>

<p>Use the green notification banner during a journey to confirm that something the user was expecting to happen has happened.</p>

{{ designExample({
  group: "components",
  item: "notification-banner",
  type: "success"
}) }}

<p>Since you're using the notification banner to tell the user about the outcome of something they've just done, add <code>role="alert"</code> so focus shifts to the notification banner on page load.</p>

<p>Remove a green notification banner when the user moves to a new page.</p>

<p>When the user finishes a linear journey, for example, a service that lets the user register for a thing, use a <a href="/design-system/patterns/confirmation-page/">confirmation page</a>, not a notification banner.</p>

<p>For long, complex services, use the <a href="/design-system/components/task-list">task list component</a>. You are unlikely to need a green notification banner on a page with a task list.</p> 

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>To make the green version of the notification banner accessible:</p>

<ul>
<li>use a heading like "Success" so that you're not relying on colour alone to convey meaning (to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html">meet WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.1 Use of colour</a>)</li>
<li>use the same heading for green notification banners within the same service so that you're identifying components that work in the same way consistently (to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-identification">meet WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.2.4 Consistent identification</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research-on-this-component">Research on this component</h2>

<p>We need more research to understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>how common it is for users to miss important information in notification banners (including users of assistive technology, who might skip straight to the <code>h1</code>)</li>
<li>whether it's sometimes helpful to allow users to dismiss notifications, and how to do this</li>
</ul>
