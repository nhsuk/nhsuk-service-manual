  <h3 id="wcag-22-affects-this-component">WCAG 2.2 affects this component</h3>
  <p>To meet new success criteria introduced in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, make sure that users can successfully:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#wcag-interact-button">interact with buttons</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>See the full list of <a href="/design-system">design system changes to meet WCAG 2.2</a>.</p>
</div>

  <p>We have 3 buttons</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#primary-button">primary button</a></li>
    <li><a href="#secondary-button">secondary button</a></li>
    <li><a href="#reverse-button">white button on solid background colour (reverse button)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="primary-button">Primary button</h2>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "buttons",
    type: "default"
  }) }}

  <h3>When to use a primary button</h3>
  <p>Use a primary button to help users carry out an action on a page like starting an application or saving their progress.</p>
  <p><a href="#when-to-use-buttons">More about when to use and not use buttons.</a></p>

  <h2 id="secondary-button">Secondary button</h2>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "buttons",
    type: "secondary"
  }) }}

  <h3>When to use a secondary button</h3>
  <p>Use a secondary button on pages that have more than 1 action or when users aren't noticing standard link text.</p>
  <p><a href="#when-to-use-buttons">More about when to use and not use buttons.</a></p>

  <h2 id="reverse-button">White button on solid background colour (reverse button)</h2>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "buttons",
    type: "reverse"
  }) }}

  <h3>When to use a white button on solid background colour</h3>
  <p>White buttons on solid background colour are good on components like interruption cards where link text, primary and secondary buttons would be lost. (There's an example on <a href="https://your-data-matters.service.nhs.uk/">the Your data matters service</a>.)</p>
  <p><a href="#when-to-use-buttons">More about when to use and not use buttons.</a></p>

  <h2 id="when-to-use-buttons">When to use buttons</h2>
  <p>Use buttons to start or save transactional journeys.</p>

  <h2 id="when-not-to-use-buttons">When not to use buttons</h2>
  <p>Do not use buttons as links:
  <ul>
    <li>to pages which aren't part of your user journey</li>
    <li>from 1 flat content page to another</li>
    <li>to external websites</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Try not to have multiple buttons on 1 page. Follow <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page">GOV.UK guidance on structuring forms and starting with one thing per page</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use-buttons">How to use buttons</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/">GOV.UK design system</a> suggests using a button to help users carry out an action on a page like starting an application or saving their progress.</p>
  <p>Write button text in sentence case and describe the action the button performs. For example "Save and continue" or "Start now".</p>
  <p>Align the primary action button to the left edge of your form.</p>


  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-interact-button" role="note">
      <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">WCAG 2.2</strong>
    <p>Do not decrease the height or target area of buttons. This is to make sure users can easily interact with buttons. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.5.8 Target Size (W3C)</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Disabled buttons</h3>
  <p>Disabled buttons have poor contrast and can confuse some users. Only use them if user research shows it makes things easier for users to understand.</p>
  <p>We have developed disabled versions of the 3 buttons but we haven't tested them yet. You can <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/tree/master/packages/components/button">get the latest disabled button code</a> in the NHS.UK frontend library in GitHub.</p>

  <h3>Colour contrast</h3>
  <p>All 3 active buttons pass AAA guidelines for colour contrast. The colour contrast ratio between text and background colour is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>primary button 5.12:1</li>
    <li>secondary button 7.75:1</li>
    <li>white button on solid background colour  14.42:1</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please note that the disabled versions of the 3 buttons do not meet accessibility colour contrast ratios. If your team has discovered a user need for disabled buttons, use them carefully and test them with users with access needs.</p>

  <h3 id="stop-users-from-accidentally-sending-information-more-than-once">Stop users from accidentally sending information more than once</h3>
  <p>Sometimes, users double click buttons because they:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>have used operating systems where they have to double click items to make them work</li>
    <li>are experiencing a slow connection which means they are not given feedback on their action quickly enough</li>
    <li>have motor impairments such as hand tremors which cause them to click the button involuntarily</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In some cases, this can mean their information is sent twice.</p>
  <p>For example, the GOV.UK Notify team discovered that a number of users were receiving invitations twice, because the person sending them was double clicking the "send" button.</p>
  <p>If your research shows that users are frequently sending information twice, you can configure the button to ignore the 2nd click.</p>
  <p>To do this, set the <code>data-prevent-double-click</code> attribute to <code>true</code>. You can do this directly in the HTML or, if you're using Nunjucks, you can use the Nunjucks macro as shown in this example.</p>

    {{ designExample({
      group: "components",
      item: "buttons",
      type: "prevent-double-click"
    }) }}

  <p>This feature will prevent double clicks for users that have JavaScript enabled. However, you should also think about the issue server-side to protect against attacks.</p>
  <p>In the case of slow connections, aim to give the user information about what's happening, for example, by showing a loading spinner or a modal, before using <code>data-prevent-double-click</code>.</p>

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
  <p>We based our buttons on the GOV.UK designs. But because our logo is a blue rectangle and a number of our components (including panel headings) have squared edges, we decided that GOV.UK buttons didnâ€™t stand out enough. The square buttons didn't look clickable next to the other square components.</p>
  <p>We made the buttons more "buttony" by rounding the corners (adding corner radiuses). There is research to suggest that rounded corners make things more clickable.</p>
  <p>Our testing confirmed this. Users were able to complete tasks using buttons and they didn't confuse them with non-clickable components.</p>
