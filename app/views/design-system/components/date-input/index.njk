  <h2>When to use date input</h2>
  <p>We follow the GOV.UK Design System. Use date input when you’re asking users for a date they already know.</p>

  <h2>When not to use date input</h2>
  <p>Do not use date input if users are unlikely to know the exact date you're asking about.</p>

  <h2>How to use date input</h2>
  <p>Date input consists of 3 fields to let users enter a day, month and year.</p>
  <p class="rich-text">Group the 3 date fields together in a <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> that describes them. You can see an example at the top of this page. The legend is usually a question, like "What is your date of birth?".</p>
  <p class="rich-text">If you are asking just <a href="/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/get-the-questions-into-order#begin-prototyping-with-1-thing-per-page">1 question per page</a> as we recommend, you can set the contents of the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> as the page heading. This is good practice as it means that screen reader users will only hear the contents once.</p>
  <p>Read more on the GOV.UK Design System about how to <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/">ask users for dates</a> and <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/labels-legends-headings/">making labels and legends headings</a>.</p>

  <h2>Error messages</h2>

    group: "components",
    item: "date-input",
    type: "with-errors"
  }) }}

  <p>Follow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/error-message">our guidance on error messages</a></li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>Our date input is based on the component in the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/date-input/">GOV.UK Design System</a>. GOV.UK says that they need to do more research to understand if users struggle to enter months as numbers and whether it's more helpful to let them enter months as text.</p>
  <p>If you've used this component, <a href="/community-and-contribution">get in touch</a> to share your user research findings.</p>
