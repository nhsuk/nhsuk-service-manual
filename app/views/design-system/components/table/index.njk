  <p>We have 3 kinds of tables:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#basic-tables">basic</a></li>
    <li><a href="#responsive-table">responsive</a></li>
    <li><a href="#sortable-table">sortable</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="when-to-use-a-table">When to use a table</h2>
  <p>Use a table to help users compare data.</p>
  <p>Aim to present a minimum of data. If you have a lot of data, try to organise it into multiple tables or multiple pages.</p>   
  
  <h2 id="when-not-to-use-a-table">When not to use a table</h2>
  <p>Use tables with caution. They may not be the best way to present information, especially for the public and on mobile screens. In staff services, complex data tables can lead to cognitive overload, a poor user experience and performance issues.</p>
  <p>There may be better ways to meet users' needs, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a plain English summary with headings and lists</li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/expanders">expanders</a></li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/tabs">tabs</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Check this in your user research.</p>
  <p>Do not use a table to lay out content on a page. Use the <a href="/design-system/styles/layout#grid">grid system</a> instead.</p>
  
  <h2 id="basic-tables">Basic tables</h2>
  <h3 id="2-column-table">2 column table</h3>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    id: "table-example",
    type: "basic"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="3-or-more-column-table">3 or more column table</h3>
  <p>If you have numeric data, right align the column header and cells to make it easier to compare numbers.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    type: "3-column"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="when-not-to-use-a-basic-table">When not to use a basic table</h3>
  <p>Do not use a basic table if your table content becomes squashed and hard to read on small screens. Use a responsive table instead.</p>
 
  <h2 id="responsive-table">Responsive table</h2>
  <p>This table has a responsive layout. On large screens it displays as a 3 column table. However, on small screens it stacks vertically.</p>
  <p>Use a responsive table when your table becomes squashed and hard to read on small screens, 768px and smaller.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    type: "responsive"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="when-not-to-use-a-responsive-table">When not to use a responsive table</h3>
  <p>Do not use a responsive table if your content is easier to read and understand on a small screen in a non-responsive layout. Use a <a href="#basic-tables">basic table</a> instead.</p>

  <h2 id="sortable-table">Sortable table</h2>
  <p>A sortable table lets users sort columns in ascending or descending order.</p>

  {# {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    type: "sortable"
  }) }} #}
  <p>[EXAMPLE HERE]</p>

  <p>This table only sorts by 1 column at a time. Users can click on the column header to trigger sorting.</p>
  <p>Carry out user research to understand what your users need to do with the data and if a sortable table is the best way to meet their needs.</p>
  <p>Find out:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>which columns they need to sort on</li>
    <li>how much data to display at once</li>
    <li>how it should be ordered by default</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The table allows users to sort:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>numerically</li>
    <li>alphabetically</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you need to sort another way, for example by dates and times or empty cells, use data attributes that contain a number.</p>
  <p>Do not allow sorting on columns that cannot be meaningfully ordered, for example paragraphs of text.</p>

  <h3 id="when-to-use-a-sortable-table">When to use a sortable table</h3>
  <p>Use this table when users need to find and prioritise data, for example in staff systems with large data sets.</p>

  <h3 id="when-not-to-use-a-sortable-table">When not to use a sortable table</h3>
  <p>Do not let users sort a table if there is no reason to sort the data, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>free text</li>
    <li>first names</li>
    <li>NHS numbers or other codes</li>
    <li>medical conditions (but you may filter instead)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Do not sort data alphabetically if it has an established logical sequence. For example, months of the year.</p>
  <p>Consider letting users search or filter results instead. Filtering cuts down the data set so users can focus on what they want. Search helps them find specific things they need. If your team is researching filtering, please feed back your findings via our <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/issues/217">community backlog issue on filtering a list (in GitHub)</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="session-storage">Session storage</h3>
  <p>Do not add code to automatically save the sorting order. Users may not expect this and it could add clinical risk.</p>
  <p>A page refresh or navigation must return the page to its default sort order. Unless you add functionality to allow users to save their sorting order explicitly.</p>

  <h3 id="server-side-sorting">Server-side sorting</h3>
  <p>This component provides client-side sorting, which only sorts the data currently shown in the table.</p>
  <p>For large data sets with many pages of data, use server-side sorting.</p>

  <h2 id="word-breaks-table">Using word-breaks in a table</h2>
  <p>To avoid very long words, such as email addresses, breaking the layout of a table, add the <code>nhsuk-u-text-break-word</code> class.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    type: "word-break"
  }) }}
  <p>Find out more about word-breaks, with or without a hyphen, in <a href="/design-system/styles/typography#breaking-up-long-words">breaking up long words in the typography section</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="missing-data-table">Displaying missing data</h2>

  <p>Do not leave empty cells in your table. The only exception can be the top left cell. If you have missing data, include some short text to explain why it's missing, such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"No data"</li>
    <li>"Not applicable"</li>
    <li>"Not known"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To distinguish the text from other table content, use the <code>nhsuk-u-secondary-text-colour</code> modifier class to make it dark grey.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    type: "missing-data"
  }) }}

  <h2 id="how-it-works">How tables work</h2>
  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
  <p>Follow <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data">WebAIM's guidance for tables</a> and:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>give tables captions</li>
    <li>use the scope attribute to associate the data cells with the appropriate headers</li>
    <li>let the browser window determine the width of the table whenever possible, to reduce horizontal scrolling</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="table-captions">Table captions</h3>
  <p>Use the <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> element to describe a table in the same way you would use a heading. A caption helps users find, navigate and understand tables.</p>
  <p>Style table captions to match the visual hierarchy of your page's content. If using Nunjucks, use the <code>captionSize</code> macro option. In HTML add the <code>nhsuk-table__caption--l</code> class. You can use sizes <code>s</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>xl</code>.</p>

  <h3 id="table-headers">Table headers</h3>
  <p>Use table headers to tell users what the rows and columns represent.</p>

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>

  <h3>Basic tables</h3>
  <p>These tables tested well with users of health information on the NHS website.</p>

  <h3>Responsive table</h3>
  <p>This table was tested at HM Revenue &amp; Customs.</p>

  <h3>Sortable table</h3>
  <p>This table was developed by NHS England and tested in WHERE.</p>
  <p>There is an overlap between sortable tables and:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>search</li>
    <li>filter</li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/pagination">pagination</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>We want to understand better how they can work together. Please get in touch if you are working on these components.</p>
  <p>We have not yet developed a responsive or scrolling sortable table. If you need a responsive sorting table, you could try adding a <a href="/design-system/components/select">select component</a>. Please feedback if you experiment with these.</p>
  <h3>Table with panel</h3>
  <p>We have also designed a table with a panel. You can <a href="https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/components/tables/as-a-panel/">find an example in the frontend library</a>. We have not included it in this list of components yet because it needs more testing.</p>
