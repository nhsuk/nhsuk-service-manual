  <p>We have 3 kinds of tables:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#basic-tables">basic</a></li>
    <li><a href="#responsive-table">responsive</a></li>
    <li><a href="#sortable-table">sortable</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use tables with caution. They may not be the best way to present information, especially for the public. In staff services, complex data tables can lead to a poor user experience and performance issues.</p>

  <h2 id="basic-tables">Basic tables</h2>
  <h3 id="2-column-table">2 column table</h3>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    id: "table-example",
    type: "basic"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="3-or-more-column-table">3 or more column table</h3>
  <p>If you have numeric data, right align the column header and cells to make it easier to compare numbers.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    type: "3-column"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="when-not-to-use-a-basic-table">When not to use a basic table</h3>
  <p>Do not use a basic table:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to lay out content on a page – use the <a href="/design-system/styles/layout#grid">grid system</a> instead</li>
    <li>if your table content becomes squashed and hard to read on small screens – use a responsive table instead</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="responsive-table">Responsive table</h2>
  <p>This table has a responsive layout. On large screens it displays as a 3 column table. However, on small screens it stacks vertically.</p>
  <p>Use a responsive table when your table becomes squashed and hard to read on small screens, 768px and smaller.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    type: "responsive"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="when-not-to-use-a-responsive-table">When not to use a responsive table</h3>
  <p>Do not use a responsive table:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to lay out content on a page – use the <a href="/design-system/styles/layout#grid">grid system</a> instead</li>
    <li>if your content is easier to read and understand on a small screen in a non-responsive layout – use a <a href="#basic-tables">basic table</a> instead</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="sortable-table">Sortable table</h2>
  <p>A sortable table lets users sort columns in ascending or descending order.</p>
  <p>Users can click on the column header to trigger sorting. They can only sort by 1 column at a time.</p>
  <p>Carry out user research to understand which columns your users need to sort on, how much data to display at once and how it should be ordered by default. Ask what your users need to do with the data?</p>
  <p>This table allows users to sort:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>numerically</li>
    <li>alphabetically</li>
    <li>by dates and times</li>
    <li>by empty or null cells</li>
  </ul>
 
  <p>[What types of data should not be sorted?]</p>

  <h3 id="when-to-use-a-sortable-table">When to use a sortable table</h3>
  <p>Use this table when users need to sort data to find what they need, for example in staff systems with large data sets.</p>

  <h3 id="when-not-to-use-a-sortable-table">When not to use a sortable table</h3>
  <p>Do not let users sort a table when the data must be viewed as is.</p>

  <h3>Session storage</h3>
  <p>Do not add code to save the sorting order. Users may not expect this and it could add clinical risk.</p>
  <p>A page refresh or navigation must return the page to its original sort order.</p>

  <h3 id="client-or-server-side-sorting">Client or server-side sorting</h3>
  <p>[What to say? E.g.] For large data sets, use server-side sorting where only the current page of data is sorted on the client side, while the rest is handled by the server.</p>

  <h2 id="word-breaks-table">Using word-breaks in a table</h2>
  <p>To avoid very long words, such as email addresses, breaking the layout of a table, add the <code>nhsuk-u-text-break-word</code> class.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    type: "word-break"
  }) }}
  <p>Find out more about word-breaks, with or without a hyphen, in <a href="/design-system/styles/typography#breaking-up-long-words">breaking up long words in the typography section</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="missing-data-table">Displaying missing data</h2>

  <p>Do not leave empty cells in your table. The only exception can be the top left cell. If you have missing data, include some short text to explain why it's missing, such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"No data"</li>
    <li>"Not applicable"</li>
    <li>"Not known"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To distinguish the text from other table content, use the <code>nhsuk-u-secondary-text-colour</code> modifier class to make it dark grey.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "table",
    type: "missing-data"
  }) }}

  <h2 id="how-it-works">How tables work</h2>
  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
  <p>Follow <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data">WebAIM's guidance for tables</a> and:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>give tables captions</li>
    <li>use the scope attribute to associate the data cells with the appropriate headers</li>
    <li>let the browser window determine the width of the table whenever possible, to reduce horizontal scrolling</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="table-captions">Table captions</h3>
  <p>Use the <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> element to describe a table in the same way you would use a heading. A caption helps users find, navigate and understand tables.</p>
  <p>Style table captions to match the visual hierarchy of your page's content. If using Nunjucks, use the <code>captionSize</code> macro option. In HTML add the <code>nhsuk-table__caption--l</code> class. You can use sizes <code>s</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>l</code>, <code>xl</code>.</p>

  <h3 id="table-headers">Table headers</h3>
  <p>Use table headers to tell users what the rows and columns represent.</p>

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>

  <h3>Basic tables</h3>
  <p>These tables tested well with users of health information on the NHS website.</p>

  <h3>Responsive table</h3>
  <p>This table was tested at HM Revenue &amp; Customs.</p>

  <h3>Sortable table</h3>
  <p>This table was developed by NHS England and tested in WHERE.</p>
  <p>There is an overlap between sortable tables and:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>search</li>
    <li>filter</li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/pagination">pagination</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>We want to understand better how they can work together. Please get in touch if you are working on these components.</p>
  <p>We have not yet developed a responsive or scrolling sortable table. If you need a responsive sorting table, you could try adding a <a href="/design-system/components/select">select component</a>. Please feedback if you experiment with these.</p>
  <h3>Table with panel</h3>
  <p>We have also designed a table with a panel. You can <a href="https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/components/tables/as-a-panel/">find an example in the frontend library</a>. We have not included it in this list of components yet because it needs more testing.</p>
