  <p>WCAG 2.2: Make sure that users can successfully <a href="#wcag-interact-row-actions">interact with row actions</a> and <a href="#wcag-change-answers">change information they've previously given in an answer</a>.</p>

  <h2>When to use summary lists</h2>
  <p>Use the summary list component to present pairs of related information, known as key-value pairs, in a list, where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the key is a label, like "Name"</li>
    <li>the value is the piece of information itself, like "John Smith"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Think about how you can use the summary list along with other components or patterns to give users a sense of control. You can use it to summarise a user's responses at the end of a form, for example as part of the <a href="/design-system/patterns/check-answers">check answers pattern</a>.</p>

  <h2>When not to use summary lists </h2>
  <p class="rich-text">The summary list uses the description list <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> HTML element, so only use it to present information that has a key and at least 1 value.</p>
  <p class="rich-text">Do not use it for tabular data or a simple list of information or tasks, like a task list page. (See the <a href="/design-system/patterns/complete-multiple-tasks">complete multiple tasks pattern</a>.) For those, use a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>.</p>

  <h2>How to use summary lists</h2>
  <p>There are 2 ways to use the summary list component. You can use HTML or, if you're using <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> or the <a href="https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk">NHS.UK prototype kit</a>, you can use the Nunjucks macro.</p>

  <h3 id="summary-list-with-actions">Summary list with actions</h3>
  <p>You can add actions to a summary list, like a "Change" link to let users go back and edit their answer.</p>

  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-interact-row-actions" role="note">
    <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">
    WCAG 2.2
  </strong>

    <p>Make sure any "Change" or other action links are at least 24px by 24px in size, or have adequate spacing. This is to make sure users can easily interact with the links. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.5.8 Target Size (W3C)</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-change-answers" role="note">
  <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
  <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">
    WCAG 2.2
  </strong>

    <p>If a user decides to go back to a previous answer through a link, make sure information they have already entered is pre-populated.</p>
    <p>Do not pre-populate if the information is no longer valid, or when pre-populating would be a major safety or security concern. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/redundant-entry.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.7 Redundant Entry (W3C)</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>People who use assistive technology, like a screen reader, may hear the links out of context and not know what they do. To give more context, add visually hidden text to the links. This means a screen reader user will hear a meaningful action, like "Change name" or "Change date of birth".</p>

  <h3 id="summary-list-without-actions">Summary list without actions</h3>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "summary-list",
    type: "without-action"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="summary-list-without-actions-or-borders">Summary list without actions or borders</h3>
  <p class="rich-text">If you do not include actions in your summary list and it would be better for your design to remove the separating borders, use the <code>nhsuk-summary-list--no-border</code> class.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "summary-list",
    type: "without-border"
  }) }}

  <p>To remove borders on a single row, use the <code>nhsuk-summary-list__row--no-border</code> class.</p>
