  <h2 id="when-to-use-the-NHS-header">When to use the header</h2>
  <p>Use the header if your service is a national NHS service in England on the nhs.uk domain.</p>

  <h2 id="when-not-to-use-the-NHS-header">When not to use the header</h2>
  <p>Do not use the NHS logo alone if your service is hosted on another domain (not nhs.uk).</p>
  <p>Use the <a href="#organisational-header">organisational header</a> instead.</p>
  <p>For information about supplier and partnership branding, see the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/">NHS identity guidelines</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use-the-NHS-header">How to use the header</h2>
  <p>The header is made up of 4 elements:</p>
  <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the NHS logo, which may be accompanied by the service name</li>
    <li>a search bar</li>
    <li>navigation, with exposed links and a drop-down "More" button</li>
    <li>account information and links</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The elements you include depend on the nature of your service and your users' needs.</p>
  <p>For example, transactional services (like <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/online-services/find-nhs-number/">Find your NHS number, on the NHS website</a>) do not usually include navigation and search, just the logo and service name. This is less distracting for users in a transactional journey.</p>

    <p>Do not make header elements, like the "More" dropdown menu, sticky to the top of the page by using <code>position: fixed</code> or any other method. In other words, avoid anything that makes the menu sit on top of page content.</p>
    <p>This is to make sure it does not hide or obscure any content which has a focus applied. This complies with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.11 Focus not Obscured (W3C)</a>.</p>

    <p>You can add a link to a "help" page in your service's header. If you do, the link must be positioned consistently in the header, and must always link to the same place.</p>
    <p>For example, a header link to "Get help with this service" must go to the same place as similar header links elsewhere in your service. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.2.6 Consistent Help (W3C)</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 id="logo-service-name">NHS logo and service name</h3>
  <p>The NHS logo must always be used. Add a service name to help users understand they're not on the main NHS website.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "header",
    type: "logo-service-name"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="search">Search bar</h3>
  <p>The header can include a search bar.</p>
  <p>If your content or service is on the NHS website and you need help with search, <a href="/service-manual-team">the service manual team</a> can put you in touch with the team that manages our search functionality.</p> 
  <p>If your service is on the nhs.uk domain but not part of the NHS website or is on another domain, you will have to arrange your own search functionality, if you need it.</p>
  
  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "header",
    type: "search"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
  <p>Help users find what they need quickly by providing consistent navigation.</p>
  <p>If your service is a linear end-to-end journey, you probably do not need navigation links. You can use the <a href="/design-system/patterns/complete-multiple-tasks">Complete multiple tasks pattern</a>.</p>
  <p>Place links to your most important top-level sections first. When there is not enough space to show all links, they will be moved into the "More" drop-down list.</p>
  <p>You can highlight the section the user is currently in.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "header",
    type: "navigation"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="account-information-and-links">Account information and links</h3>
  <p>The header can include account information and links for logged in users.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "header",
    type: "account-basic"
  }) }}

  <h4>When to use</h4>
  <p>Use on services when users have an account. The header can display a log out link and other account-related information and links.</p>
  <p>It has been designed for staff systems. If you want to use it on a public-facing service, you must test it first and <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/issues/16">feed back your findings</a>.</p>

  <h4>How to use</h4>
  <p>Account information and links can be used with the other header features, for example service name and search. However, keep the number of items in the header to a minimum.</p>
  <p>When allowing users to log in to your service, make sure you have a visible service name, so that they know which system they are logging in to.</p>

  <h4>Using account information and links</h4>
  <p>You can add multiple items to the account information and links section, such as the logged in user’s name and role. Items can be links or just plain text information.</p>
  <p>Keep the number of links to a minimum. If you have more than 3 account links, consider combining functions and placing them on a separate page. For example, an account settings page could include actions like change name, change role and reset password. Testing with users should inform which combination of items will best meet their needs.</p>
  <p>If showing a log out link, place it last in the list, showing top right on desktop screens and last on small screens. If placing log out and other account actions on a dedicated page, it's link should be shown last.</p>

  <h4>User information</h4>
  <p>Consider whether you need to show the user information about the account they have logged into. This may depend on whether:</p>
  <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the computer they are likely to use is shared</li>
    <li>they are likely to have multiple accounts or roles</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When showing the user their account, you can highlight this with the user profile icon. Only show the icon next to one item. Your user research will inform how best to display the user’s account information, for example, whether to show their full name or their email address.</p>

  <h4>Header with complex account information and links</h4>
  <p>An example showing account information and multiple links, with a service name and navigation.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "header",
    type: "account-complex"
  }) }}

  <h2 id="organisational-header">Organisational header</h2>
  <p>Use the organisational header if your organisation or service is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a regional or local NHS service, such as an NHS trust</li>
    <li>not on an nhs.uk domain</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are 3 variants of the organisational header:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>blue background</li>
    <li>white background with blue nav</li>
    <li>white background with white nav</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Blue background organisational header</h3>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "header",
    type: "organisational"
  }) }}

  <h3>White background organisational header with blue nav</h3>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "header",
    type: "organisational-white"
  }) }}

  <h3>White background organisational header with white nav</h3>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "header",
    type: "organisational-white-with-nav"
  }) }}

  <p>You must have a Frutiger font licence to use an NHS organisational logo. Our guidance on <a href="/design-system/styles/typography">typography</a> explains how to get hold of the Frutiger webfont.</p>
  
  <h3>Organisational logos</h3>  
  <p>Read more about creating NHS <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/organisational-logos/">organisational logos in the NHS England identity guidelines</a>.</p>
  <p>The organisational logo is an SVG (scalable vector graphic) and you can change the organisation name and descriptor in the code. Longer organisation names should be split onto 2 lines.</p>
  <p>You can also use a static asset, such as a PNG file.</p>

{# <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>The NHS header was updated in September 2023. It includes exposed navigation links and a drop down that says "More" instead of a menu button. The search box now fills the width of the screen on mobile.</p>
<p>On the NHS website, we found that exposing main topics helps users navigate and find what they're looking for. The dynamic resizing and the "More" button help users on mobile navigate top tasks.</p>  #}
