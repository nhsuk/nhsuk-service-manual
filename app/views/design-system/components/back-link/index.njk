<h2>When to use a back link</h2>
<p>We only use back links on transactional services or multi-page forms.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/back-link/">GOV.UK design system</a> recommends
  including a back link on question pages. Read more about <a
    href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages">question pages on GOV.UK</a>.</p>
<p>You can include a back link on other pages in a multi-page transaction, if it makes sense to do so.</p>

<h2>When not to use a back link</h2>
<p>Do not use a back link on a content page, like a health information page.</p>
<p>Do not use a back link with <a href='/design-system/components/breadcrumbs'>breadcrumbs</a>.</p>

<h2>How to use back links</h2>
<p>Make sure the text used in the link describes the action, for example "Go back". Carry out research with users to
  find the words that help them the most.</p>
<p>The link should take users back to the page they were on in the state they last saw it.</p>

<div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-avoid-information-reentry" role="note">
  <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
  <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">
    WCAG 2.2
  </strong>

  <p>If a user goes back to a previous page, make sure information they have already entered is pre-populated.</p>
  <p>Do not pre-populate if the information is no longer valid, or when pre-populating would be a major safety or security concern. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/redundant-entry.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.7 Redundant Entry (W3C)</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Consider where you put the back link. Do not put it close to other links or buttons where it might distract users
  from what they need to do. Also think about people who use a screen reader. </p>

<div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-interact-back-links" role="note">
  <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
  <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">
    WCAG 2.2
  </strong>

  <p>Make sure no other interactive elements are too close to the back link so users can easily
    interact with it. This is to comply with <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.5.8 Target Size (W3C)</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/back-link/">GOV.UK design system</a> says that you
  should put back links at the top of a page, but a couple of NHS services (<a href="https://111.nhs.uk/">NHS 111
    online</a> and <a href="https://your-data-matters.service.nhs.uk">Find out why your NHS data matters</a>) found that
  it works better at the bottom of the page below the primary action. That's because we don't want to suggest to people
  who use a screen reader that they leave the page prematurely.</p>

<h3 id="back-link-as-a-button">Back link as a button</h3>
<p class="rich-text">You can render the back link as a <code>button</code> element if necessary in order to post form
  data back to the previous page.</p>

{{ designExample({
group: "components",
item: "back-link",
type: "button"
}) }}


<h2>Research</h2>
<p>During testing, <a href="https://111.nhs.uk/">NHS 111 online</a> found that some users wanted to change their
  answers, so they introduced a back link and labelled it to "Change my previous answer".</p>
<p>An accessibility audit recommended that <a
    href="https://your-data-matters.service.nhs.uk/">Find out why your NHS data matters</a> place their back link below
  the primary action, because screen reader users were confused when they landed on a page and were immediately told to
  go back.</p>
