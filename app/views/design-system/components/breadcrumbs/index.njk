<h2>When to use breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>Use breadcrumbs to give users context and let them move back or up a level if they can't find what they want on the
  page.</p>

<h2>When not to use breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>Don't use breadcrumbs in transactional journeys as they can get in the way of the user completing the task.</p>

<h2>How to use breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>If the full breadcrumb trail doesn't fit the screen size, it can wrap onto 2 lines, but don't break a breadcrumb if
  it doesn't fit the line.</p>

<div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-interact-breadcrumbs" role="note">

    WCAG 2.2
  </strong>
  <p>Make sure no other interactive elements are too close to the breadcrumbs. This is to make sure users can easily
    interact with the breadcrumbs. This is to comply with <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.5.8 Target Size (W3C)</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>You don't need to show the current page in the breadcrumb because this information is in the H1.</p>
<p>On mobile, we replace the full breadcrumb trail with a "Back to [parent]" link.</p>
<p>We use <code>aria-label="breadcrumb"</code> as a label in the nav element to let people who use
  screen readers know what it is.</p>

<h2 id="breadcrumbs-on-dark-backgrounds">Breadcrumbs on dark backgrounds</h2>
<p>Use the <code>nhsuk-breadcrumb--reverse</code> modifier class to show white links and arrows on dark backgrounds – for example, in headers, custom components, and patterns with darker backgrounds.</p>
<p>Make sure all users can see the breadcrumbs – the background colour must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 with white to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html">meet WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum), level AA</a>.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>We tested breadcrumbs on pages with lots of content about conditions or medicines. They helped people understand
  their place on the website. People noticed them and appreciated the context they gave. People also used them to get
  back to where they came from or to get back home.</p>
<p>We took out the breadcrumb links when we tested our pages in transactional journeys (in more than 3 labs). We thought that having breadcrumb links would distract users from completing the journey. We found that they did not need the breadcrumbs because they were focused on the task.</p>
