<p>The task list component displays all the tasks a user needs to do, and allows users to easily identify which ones are done and which they still need to do.</p>

{{ designExample({
  group: "components",
  item: "task-list",
  type: "default"
}) }}

<h2 id="when-to-use-the-task-list">When to use the task list</h2>

<p>If your users have to get through a long or complex service, use the task list to give them more control. For example, if some users cannot complete the tasks in one sitting.</p>
<p>You can also use a task list to allow users to complete tasks in the order they choose. This will help them plan their time and complete sections as and when they can.</p>

<h2 id="when-not-to-use-the-task-list">When not to use the task list</h2>
<p>Try to simplify the service before you use a task list. If you're able to reduce the number of tasks or steps involved, you might not need one.</p>
<p>Do not use the task list as a way of showing users their answers. For this, use a <a href="/design-system/components/summary-list/">summary list</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-task-list-works">How the task list works</h2>

<p>Where possible, let users complete tasks in whatever order they like.</p>
<p>The status alongside the task indicates whether they can start it. Users can select a task to start completing it. Once they have completed it and returned to the task list, the status for that task will have changed to "Completed".</p>
<p>Users can only move on from the task list when all tasks are shown as "Completed".</p>
<p>Find more information about how to use the task list in a service in the <a href="/design-system/patterns/complete-multiple-tasks/">complete multiple tasks pattern guidance</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>

<p>Tasks are usually actions that the user needs to take to complete a service.</p>
<p>Each task in a task list includes a task name and a status. It can also include hint text if you decide this is needed.</p>
<p>The whole row turns grey on hover to show that it is linked, allowing users to select anywhere in it to start the task.</p>

<h4>Write clear task descriptions</h4>
<p>The task name gives users a reasonable expectation of what that task is about. For example, "Your contact details" or "Upload evidence". Use sentence case and keep it short. Users of screen readers might find it difficult to navigate the task list if the task names are too long.</p>
<p>If you're finding it difficult to come up with a clear and concise task name, it might be because the task itself is too complex and may need to be separated into smaller tasks. Group questions and actions into tasks in a way that makes sense to users, based on their needs.</p>

<h4>Adding hint text</h4>
<p>Only use hint text if there is evidence that the user needs more information about what the task will include.</p>
<p>Keep hint text to a single, short sentence. Screen readers read out the entire text when users interact with the task link. This could frustrate users if the text is long.</p>
<p>Do not include links in the hint text. The whole task row links users to the task itself, so any links in the hint text will not work.</p>

<h4>Grouping tasks</h4>
<p>If there are a lot of tasks to complete, you might find that grouping them makes it easier for users to understand and plan what they need to do. Tasks can be grouped into separate task lists on a page. Give each task list a short heading that clearly explains the grouping.</p>

<h3 id="statuses">Statuses</h3>
<p>Statuses use colour and a short descriptor to give users a quick overview of how much of the task list they have completed, and how much is left to do.</p>

<h2 id="research-on-the-task-list">Research on the task list</h2>
<p>The GOV.UK design system developed and tested this component. Find out more about their research on the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/task-list/">GOV.UK task list page</a>.</p>

<p>If you are using this component in a service, we would like to hear about any user research so that we can identify any potential issues.</p>
