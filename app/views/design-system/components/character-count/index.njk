  <p>Help users know how much text they can enter when there is a limit on the number of characters.</p>

  <h2 id="when-to-use">When to use this component</h2>
  <p>Always test your service without a character count first.</p>
  <p>Only use the character count component when there is a good reason for limiting the number of characters users can enter. For example, if there is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>evidence that users are likely to enter more information than they need to</li>
    <li>a legal or technical reason that means an entry must be no more than a certain number of characters</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="when-not-to-use">When not to use this component</h2>
  <p>If your users keep hitting the character limit imposed by the backend of your service then try to increase the limit rather than use a character count.</p>
