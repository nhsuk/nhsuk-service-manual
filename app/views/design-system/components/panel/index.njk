  <h2 id="when-to-use">When to use a panel</h2>
  <p>Use the panel component to display important information when a transaction has been completed.</p>
  <p>In most cases, the panel component is used on <a href="/design-system/patterns/confirmation-page">confirmation pages</a>, to tell the user they have successfully completed the transaction.</p>

  <h2 id="when-not-to-use">When not to use a panel</h2>
  <p>Never use the panel component to highlight important information in body content. Instead consider using:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/inset-text">inset text</a></li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/warning-callout">warning callout</a></li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/patterns/help-users-decide-when-and-where-to-get-care">the pattern to help users decide when and where to get care (care cards)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a panel</h2>
  <p>A panel is made up of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a heading that confirms what has happened</li>
    <li>description text, which is optional</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="how-to-write-panel-text">How to write panel text</h3>
  <p>Keep your panel text brief. It only needs to summarise what has happened. For example, "Application complete".</p>
  <p>Use short words and phrases to make sure highlighted information is easy to read at different screen sizes. Shorter text is less likely to wrap around the panel, which can happen when using the zoom function on mobiles.</p>
  <p>If you need to give detailed information, or more context, use the description text under the heading text.</p>
