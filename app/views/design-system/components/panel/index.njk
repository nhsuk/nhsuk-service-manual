  [add example here]

  <h2 id="when-to-use">When to use a panel</h2>
  <p>Use the panel component to display important information when a transaction has been  completed.
  <p>In most cases, the panel component is used on <a href="/design-system/patterns/confirmation-pages">confirmation pages</a>, to tell the user they have successfully completed the transaction.</p>

  <h2 id="when-not-to-use">When not to use a panel</h2>
  <p>Never use the panel component to highlight important information within body content.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a panel</h2>
  <p>(Some info about heading and descriptive text?)</p>

  <h3 id="how-to-write-panel-text">How to write panel text</h3>
  <p>Keep your panel text brief, as it's only meant for a high-level explanation of what has happened. For example, "Application complete".</p>
  <p>Use short words and phrases to make sure highlighted information is easy to read at different screen sizes. A shorter amount of information is less likely to wrap around the panel, which can happen when using the zoom function on mobiles.</p>
  <p>If you need to give detailed information, or more context, use the description text under the heading text.</p>
