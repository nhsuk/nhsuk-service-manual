  <h2 id="when-to-use">When to use a panel</h2>
  <p>Use the panel component to display important information when a transaction has been completed.</p>
  <p>In most cases, the panel component is used on <a href="/design-system/patterns/confirmation-page">confirmation pages</a>, to tell the user they have successfully completed the transaction.</p>

  <h2 id="when-not-to-use">When not to use a panel</h2>
  <p>Never use the panel component to highlight important information in body content. Instead consider using:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/inset-text">inset text</a></li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/warning-callout">warning callout</a></li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/patterns/help-users-decide-when-and-where-to-get-care">the pattern to help users decide when and where to get care (care cards)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a panel</h2>
  <p>A panel is made up of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a heading that confirms what has happened</li>
    <li>description text, which is optional</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="how-to-write-panel-text">How to write panel text</h3>

  <p>Keep your panel heading text brief. It only needs to summarise what has happened. For example, "Application complete".</p>

  <p>Use short words and phrases to make sure highlighted information is easy to read at different screen sizes. Shorter text is less likely to wrap around the panel, which can happen when using the zoom function on mobiles.</p>

  <p>If the panel heading needs to be longer, you can reduce the text size by adding the <code>nhsuk-panel__title--l</code> class.</p>

  <p>You can add more context or details by using additional text under the heading.</p>

  <h3 id="interruption">Interruption panels</h3>

  <p>Use an interruption panel if you need to draw a userâ€™s attention to something important. See <a href="/design-system/patterns/interruption">interruption pattern</a> for further guidance.</p>
