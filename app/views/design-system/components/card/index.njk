  <h2 id="when-to-use">When to use a card</h2>
  <p>Use a card to give users a brief summary of content or a task, often with a link to more detail. You can display a card alongside other cards to group related content or tasks.</p>
  <p>Use clickable cards on hub pages to signpost groupings of related content and help users navigate to the content they need.</p> 
  <p>You can use a basic, non-clickable card on content pages.</p>
  <p>These cards are different from the pattern to <a href="/design-system/patterns/help-users-decide-when-and-where-to-get-care">help users decide when and where to get care (care cards)</a>.</p>
  
  <h2 id="how-to-use-cards">How to use cards</h2>
  <p>Make cards easy to scan for relevant and actionable information.</p>
  <p>You can include multiple elements, such as a title, text, an image and links. If you include a link, the link should mirror the heading of the page it links to.</p>
  
  <h3>Clickable cards</h3>

  <p>If the card contains a single link, you can make the hit area for the link wrap the entire card. We avoid wrapping an entire card in an anchor tag as this can be a difficult experience for screen reader users.</p>

  <h4 id="top-task-card">Top task card</h4>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "top-task"
  }) }}
  
  <p>Top task cards are small clickable cards.</p>
  <p>Use them at the top of hub pages above other cards (such as primary cards) to help users quickly access specific information or tasks buried deeper in the navigation. Use them as shortcuts to content or services that are popular with users or meet an important business need.</p>  
  <p>If you want to link to a page just below the hub page, use a primary card instead.</p>
  <p>Do not use more than 3 top tasks on a hub page.</p>
  <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/">The NHS services hub page on the NHS website</a> uses 3 top task cards to help people get help quickly.</p>
  </div>

  <h4 id="primary-card-with-chevron">Primary card (with chevron)</h4>
  
    {{ designExample({
      group: "components",
      item: "card",
      type: "primary-card"
    }) }}

  <p>Use primary cards on hub pages to signpost groups of information that are important to users.</p> 
  <p>You can include a primary card that links to a single page at a lower level if other primary cards on the same hub page link to groups of content.</p>
  <p>The chevron icon (from our <a href="/design-system/styles/icons">icon set</a>) helps users know the card will take them to more content. The size of the card helps them understand that the topics these cards link to are more frequently visited or more important than topics signposted by secondary cards.</p> 
  <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/">The Social care and support guide hub page on the NHS website</a> routes users to different social care topics using primary cards.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Primary cards with chevrons replace a similar clickable card without a chevron which is being phased out.</p>
  
  <h4 id="secondary-card">Secondary card</h4>
  
  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "secondary-card"
  }) }}

  <p>Use secondary cards on hub pages to signpost groups of information on less important topics. Use them below primary cards which signpost important information.</p> 
  <p>Secondary cards have less visual impact than top tasks or primary cards.</p>
  <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/">The NHS services hub page on the NHS website</a> has secondary cards at the bottom of the page for topics that are less searched for.</p>
  </div>

  <h4 id="card-with-an-image">Card with an image</h4>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "with-image"
  }) }}

  <p>Only use cards with images if you have evidence that they help your users, for example, where you can show that they motivate users.</p>
  <p>The card image is set as a decorative image by default, with the <a href="/accessibility/content#use-alternative-text-for-images-in-content">alternative text</a> being null.</p>

  <h3 id="non-clickable-basic-card">Non-clickable basic card</h3>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "default"
  }) }}

  <p>Use basic cards on content pages, not hub pages.</p> 
  <p>Consider using these components instead:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/design-system/patterns/help-users-decide-when-and-where-to-get-care">a care card to help users decide when and where to get care</a></li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/inset-text">inset text</a></li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/warning-callout">a warning callout</a></li> 
  </ul>

  <h3 id="grouping-cards">Grouping cards</h3>
  <p>You can group multiple cards to show a collection of related topics. Prioritise the cards so the content users need most comes first.</p>
  <p>Use different card styles to help users understand the importance of different groups of cards.</p>
  <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/">The Live Well hub page on the NHS website</a> helps users see the breadth of information available. It groups, ranks and links to content on different topics using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>top task cards</li>
      <li>primary cards</li>
      <li>secondary cards</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h4 id="card-width">Card width</h4>
  <p>We define the width of the cards using the <a href="/design-system/styles/layout#grid">grid system</a>. For example,  <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-half</code> is used to make the cards half width:</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "group-half"
  }) }}

  <p>For thirds, use <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-third</code>:</p>
  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "group-third"
  }) }}

  <p>For quarters, use <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-quarter</code>:</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "group-quarter"
  }) }}

  <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
  <h3 id="heading-level-and-size">Heading level and size</h3>
  <p><a href="/accessibility/design#use-headings-correctly">Use headings correctly</a> to reflect the page structure. If you need to, change the level of the heading.</p>
  <p>Here's an example of replacing the default <code>h2</code> heading with an <code>h3</code>:</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "heading-level"
  }) }}
  <p>You can change the size of the heading using <a href="/design-system/styles/typography#headings">heading typography styles</a>.</p>
  <p>Here's an example of using an <code>h2</code> with an <code>nhsuk-heading-s</code> class to reduce the size of the heading:</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "heading-size"
  }) }}

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
  <p>We have tested cards on the NHS website, Summary Care Record and NHS login help centre. We found that they helped users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>scan for relevant information</li>
    <li>decide where to go next</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We tested 3 card variations as part of an iterative process to improve the NHS website's information architecture and navigation patterns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>top task cards</li>
    <li>primary cards</li>
    <li>secondary cards</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We tested the cards in usability sessions and monitored analytics to understand how successful they were.</p>
