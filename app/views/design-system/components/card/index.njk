  <h2 id="when-to-use">When to use a card</h2>
  <p>Use a card to help users identify related content or actions they may need.</p>
  <p>You can display a card alongside other cards, but if you are grouping cards to create a hub page (sometimes called a landing page) use the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/patterns">hub page pattern</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="when-not-to-use">When not to use a card</h2>
  <p>Do not use a card to highlight content on the page of long form content.</p>
  <p>Before using a card consider using:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/care-cards">care card</a>, to help users identify and understand the care they need, who to contact and how quickly</li>
    <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/details">details</a>, to make a page easier to scan by letting users reveal more detailed information</li>
    <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/expander">expander</a>, to make a complex topic easier to digest by letting users reveal more detailed information</li>
    <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/inset-text">inset text</a>, to help users identify and understand important content on the page</li>
    <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/tabs">tabs</a>, to let users navigate between related sections of content, displaying 1 section at a time</li>
    <li><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/warning-callout">warning callout</a>, to help users identify and understand warning content on a page</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-to-use">How to use a card</h2>

  <p>There are two types of cards: 
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#primary-card">primary card</a></li>
    <li><a href="#secondary-card">secondary card</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Both cards can be clickable or non clickable.</p>
  <p>A card can include different elements, such as a heading, text, link, <a href="#image">image</a>, and <a href="#action">action</a>. If you include a link, the link should mirror the heading of the page it links to.</p>
  <p>For clickable cards, avoid wrapping the entire card in an anchor tag as this can be a difficult experience for screen reader users.</p>
  <p>Keep the card short so it is easy to scan for relevant and actionable information.</p>

  <h3 id="primary-card">Primary card</h3>
  <p>The primary cards have a higher visual prominence than secondary cards.</p>

  <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Primary card clickable</h4>
  
  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "primary-card-clickable"
  }) }}

    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Primary card with chevron</h4>
  <p>This primary card uses the chevron icon to make this even more visually prominent, helping it stand out from the other cards.</p>
  <p>There is only a clickable version of this card.</p>
  <p>This card is also used in the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/patterns">hub page pattern</a></p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "primary-card"
  }) }}

  <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Primary card non-clickable</h4>

  <p>Use the non-clickable card when you are using more than one link.</p>
  
    {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "primary-card-non-clickable"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="secondary-card">Secondary card</h3>
  <p>The secondary card has a less visual impact than the primary cards.</p>
  <p>When used with other cards, use the secondary card to group less important content or actions.</p>
  
  <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Secondary card clickable</h4>

  <p>This card is also used in the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/patterns">hub page pattern</a></p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "secondary-card"
  }) }}

  <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Secondary card non-clickable</h4>

  <p>Use the non-clickable card when you have more than one link in the content.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "secondary-card-non-clickable"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="image">Adding image</h3>
  <p>Images added to a card will be displayed above the heading and text. The image is set as a decorative image by default, with the alternative text being null.</p>
  <p>Only use cards with images if you have evidence that they help your users, for example, where you can show that they motivate users.</p>
  
  <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Image card clickable</h4>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "with-image"
  }) }}

  <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Image card non-clickable</h4>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "with-image-non-clickable"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="action">Adding actions</h3>
  <p>You can add actions to the card's header, they are shown below the heading on small screens and right aligned on bigger screens.</p>
  <p>Card actions cannot be used on clickable cards because the entire card is 1 clickable link.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "card-actions"
  }) }}

  <p>Write link text for card actions to tell the user what the card action will do and that it will apply to the entire card. Keep it short and do not add more than 2 to 3 actions in a header.</p>
  <p>Example card actions include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove appointment</li>
    <li>Edit appointment</li>
    <li>Update issue</li>
    <li>Approve application</li>
    <li>Cancel order</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Card titles must be unique and help identify what the card contains. Keep titles short and relevant. When card actions are read aloud by screen readers, the card title will be prefixed, making each action link unique.</p>
  <p>If a card action cannot easily be undone or might have serious consequences, consider adding a warning or asking the user for confirmation.</p>

  <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Grouping cards</h3>
  <p>You can group multiple cards to show a collection of related topics or highlight key information and figures.</p>
  <p>If you are grouping cards to create a hub page (sometimes called a landing page) use the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/patterns">Hub page pattern</a>.</p>

  <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Card width</h4>
  <p>We define the width of the cards using the grid system. For example, <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-half</code> is used to make the cards half width:</p>

    {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "group-half"
  }) }}

  <p>For thirds, use <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-third</code>:</p>
  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "group-third"
  }) }}

  <p>For quarters, use <code>nhsuk-grid-column-one-quarter</code>:</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "group-quarter"
  }) }}

  <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
  <h3 id="heading-level-and-size">Heading level and size</h3>
  <p><a href="/accessibility/design#use-headings-correctly">Use headings correctly</a> to reflect the page structure. If you need to, update the default H2 heading.</p>
  <p>Here's an example of replacing the default <code>h2</code> heading with an <code>h3</code>:</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "heading-level"
  }) }}
  <p>You can change the size of the heading using <a href="/design-system/styles/typography#headings">heading typography styles</a>.</p>
  <p>Here's an example of using an <code>h2</code> with an <code>nhsuk-heading-s</code> class to reduce the size of the heading:</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "card",
    type: "heading-size"
  }) }}

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
  <p>We have tested cards on the NHS website, summary care record and NHS login help centre. We found that they helped users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>scan for relevant information</li>
    <li>decide where to go next</li>
  </ul>
