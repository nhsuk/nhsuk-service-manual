  <h2 id="when-to-use-the-footer">When to use the footer</h2>
  <p>Use the footer at the bottom of every page of your website or service but not on a mobile app.</p>

  <h2 id="how-to-use-the-footer">How to use the footer</h2>
  <h3 id="footer-with-key-links">Footer with key links only</h3>

      {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "footer",
    type: "default"
  }) }}

  <p>Add links to policies and other meta information about your service, such as:
  <ul>
    <li>accessibility</li>
    <li>contact details</li>
    <li>cookies</li>
    <li>privacy policy</li>
    <li>terms and conditions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Keep links to a minimum, especially in a transactional journey. Too many links can distract users. Link to specific policies for the transaction, if appropriate.</p>
  <p>If your total number of links is less than 7, arrange them horizontally in lines.</p>

  <h3 id="footer-with-navigation-links">Footer with navigation links</h3>
  <p>If your users need lots of footer links to help them navigate a complex information architecture, include navigation links and arrange the links in columns.</p>  
  <p>For example, the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS website</a> has 4 columns of links, with key policy links in the last column.</p>  
  <p>The navigation links give users another route to the most visited content on the site. They act as a safety net for users who have not found content through the main navigation.</p> 
  <p>On tablets or smaller devices, there is a white line above the key policy links.</p>

    group: "components",
    item: "footer",
    type: "columns"
  }) }}

  <h3>Copyright</h3>
  <p>Your copyright statement must reflect the ownership of your website or service. The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS website</a> is (c) Crown copyright but the NHS generally does not have Crown status. The service manual footer, for example, says (c) NHS England.</p>
  <p>Include a reference to the <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government Licence</a> if your organisation or service encourages people to reuse and adapt its information under the licence.</p>
  <p>Contact your legal team for advice.</p>
  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <p>In 2023, we updated the NHS footer colours to improve accessibility with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>dark blue links that turn dark pink on hover</li>
    <li>the copyright statement in dark grey</li>
  </ul>
