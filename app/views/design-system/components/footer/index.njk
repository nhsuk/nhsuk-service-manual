  <p>To meet new success criteria introduced in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2, make sure that users can successfully:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#wcag-consistent-links">find help links in a consistent place on each page</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>See the full list of <a href="/design-system">design system changes to meet WCAG 2.2</a>.</p>

    group: "components",

  <h2 id="when-to-use-the-footer">When to use the footer</h2>
  <p>Use the footer at the bottom of every page of your website or service but not on a mobile app.</p>

      {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "footer",
    type: "default"
  }) }}

  <p>Add links to policies and other meta information about your service, such as:
  <ul>
    <li>accessibility</li>
    <li>contact details</li>
    <li>cookies</li>
    <li>privacy policy</li>
    <li>terms and conditions</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-consistent-links" role="note">
    <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">
    WCAG 2.2
  </strong>
  
    <p>If you include links to "help" pages in a footer, make sure to place those links consistently in the footer content. Also make sure that "help" links always work in a similar way across each page. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.2.6 Consistent Help (W3C)</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Keep links to a minimum, especially in a transactional journey. Too many links can distract users. Link to specific policies for the transaction, if appropriate.</p>
  <p>If your total number of links is less than 7, arrange them horizontally in lines.</p>

  <h3 id="footer-with-navigation-links">Footer with navigation links</h3>
  <p>If your users need lots of footer links to help them navigate a complex information architecture, include navigation links and arrange the links in columns.</p>  
  <p>For example, the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS website</a> has 4 columns of links, with key policy links in the last column.</p>  
  <p>The navigation links give users another route to the most visited content on the site. They act as a safety net for users who have not found content through the main navigation.</p> 
  <p>On tablets or smaller devices, there is a white line above the key policy links.</p>

      {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "footer",
    type: "columns"
  }) }}
