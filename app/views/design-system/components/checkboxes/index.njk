    <p>Added smaller checkboxes in version 10.1</p>
    <p>Made <a href="/design-system/guides/updating-to-v10#checkboxes">"breaking code changes" to checkboxes in version 10</a></p>

  <h2>When to use checkboxes</h2>
  <p>Use checkboxes when you need to help users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>select more than 1 option from a list</li>
    <li>toggle a single option on or off</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When not to use checkboxes</h2>
  <p>Do not use the checkboxes component if users can only choose 1 option from a selection. In this case, use a <a href="/design-system/components/radios">radio</a>.</p>

  <h2>How to use checkboxes</h2>
  <p>Position checkboxes to the left of their labels. This makes them easier to find, especially for users of screen magnifiers.</p>
  <p>Do not pre-select checkbox options as this makes it more likely that users will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>not realise they've missed a question</li>
    <li>submit the wrong answer</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Order checkbox options alphabetically by default. In some cases, it's helpful to order them from most-to-least common options, for example, by population size. But be careful, as this can reinforce bias. If in doubt, order alphabetically.</p>
  <p>Group checkboxes together in a <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> that describes them. You can see an example at the top of this page. The legend is usually a question, like "How would you like to be contacted?".</p>
  <p>Read more about using <a href="/design-system/components/fieldset">fieldset</a>.</p>


  <h3 id="checkboxes-with-hint-text">Checkboxes with hint text</h3>
  <p>Unlike with <a href="/design-system/components/radios">radios</a>, users can select more than 1 option from a list of checkboxes. Do not assume that users will know how many options they can select.</p>
  <p>Use hint text to <a href="/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/write-the-supporting-content-for-your-form#give-users-help-in-context">give users help in context</a>. For example, say "Select all the options that are relevant to you". Read more about <a href="/design-system/components/hint-text">hint text</a>.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "checkboxes",
    type: "hint"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="checkbox-items-with-hints">Checkbox items with hints</h3>
  <p>You can add hints to checkbox items to provide additional information about the options.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "checkboxes",
    type: "items-with-hints"
  }) }}

  <h3 id="none-option">Add an option for "none"</h3>
  <p>You can give users the option to say none of the other options apply to them. </p>
  <p>This option means users need to actively select "none" rather than leave all the boxes unchecked, which makes sure they do not skip the question by accident.</p>
  <p>Remember to start by asking 1 question per page. You might be able to remove the need for a "none" option by asking the user a better question or by <a href="/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/use-filter-questions-to-route-users">using filter questions</a> to filter users out beforehand.</p>
  <p>Show the "none" option last. Separate it from the other options using a divider, normally the word "or".</p>
  <p>Write a label that repeats the key part of the question. For example, for the question "Do you have any of these symptoms?", say "No, I do not have any of these symptoms". Avoid phrases like "none of the above" because this is a visual reference and might be hard for people who use screen readers to understand.</p>
  <p>To enable some JavaScript that unchecks all other checkboxes when the user clicks "none", add the <code>data-checkbox-exclusive</code> behaviour to the "none" checkbox.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "checkboxes",
    type: "none-option"
  }) }}

  <p>If JavaScript is unavailable, and a user selects both the "none" checkbox and another checkbox, display an error message.</p>

  <h3 id="conditionally-revealing-question">Conditionally revealing a related question</h3>
  <p>You can add a conditionally revealing related question to checkboxes, so users only see the question when it's relevant to them.</p>
  <p>For example, you could reveal a phone number input only when a user chooses to be contacted by phone.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "checkboxes",
    type: "conditional"
  }) }}

  <p>Keep it simple. If you need to add a lot of content, consider showing it on the next page in the process instead.</p>
  <p>Only conditionally reveal questions. Do not show or hide anything that is not a question.</p>

  <h4>Known issues</h4>
  <p>Users are not always notified when a conditionally revealed question is shown or hidden. This fails <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2 name, role, value (W3C)</a>.</p>
  <p>However, GOV.UK found that screen reader users did not have difficulty answering a conditionally revealed question as long as it’s simple. It confused users when they conditionally revealed complicated questions.</p>

  <h3 id="smaller-checkboxes">Smaller checkboxes</h3>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "checkboxes",
    type: "smaller"
  }) }}

  <p>Use standard-sized checkboxes in most cases.</p>
  <p>You can use small checkboxes where you need something less visually prominent. For example, on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a page of search results where users need to see and change search filters without distracting them from the results</li>
    <li>on information-dense screens in services designed for repeat use, like staff-facing systems</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="error-messages">Error messages</h3>
  <p>Error messages should be styled like this:</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "checkboxes",
    type: "error-messages"
  }) }}

  <p>Follow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/error-message">our guidance on error messages</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/checkboxes#error-messages">GOV.UK design system guidance on error messages for checkboxes</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>Our checkboxes are based on the GOV.UK design system. Read a <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/30/weve-updated-the-radios-and-checkboxes-on-gov-uk/">GOV.UK blog post about their updates to radios and checkboxes</a>.</p>
