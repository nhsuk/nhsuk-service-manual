  <h2>When to use pagination</h2>
  <p>Use pagination at the bottom of the page to help users navigate backwards and forwards through a series of related pages. For example, pages of search results or information about a health condition that's divided into multiple web pages (ideally no more than 8).</p>
  <p>Consider using pagination when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>showing all the content on a single page makes the page take too long to load</li>
    <li>most users only need the content on the 1st page or 1st few pages</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When not to use pagination</h2>
  <p>Only break up content onto separate pages if it improves the performance or usability of your service.</p>
  <p>Do not use pagination on pages which are not grouped together or "related" as this is likely to confuse users.</p>
  <p>Avoid using the "infinite scroll" technique to automatically load content when the user approaches the bottom of the page. This causes problems for keyboard users.</p>
  <p>Do not use pagination in a transactional service or a form. We use other components instead, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/buttons">buttons</a> (usually a "Continue" button) to move forward
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/back-link">back link</a> to navigate back</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to use pagination</h2>
  <p>Add the pagination component after the content on each page that you're paginating.</p>
  <p>Do not show pagination if there's only 1 page of content.</p>
  <p>Redirect users to the 1st page if they enter a URL of a page that no longer exists.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "pagination",
    type: "default"
  }) }}

  <p>If you're using pagination at the bottom of  content pages, you should also use a <a href="/design-system/components/contents-list">contents list</a> at the top of the page. The 2 components make up the multi-page navigation pattern.</p>
  <p>Use the word "Previous" with an arrow left and a link to the previous page. Use the same page titles as in the contents list.</p>

  <h3 id="for-navigating-between-pages-of-items">For navigating between pages of items</h3>
  <p>Use a list-type layout if users need to navigate through pages of similar items. For example, a list of search results or a list of cases in a case working system.</p>
  <p>ADD CODED EXAMPLE</p>

  <p>Show the page number in the page <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> so that screen reader users know they've navigated to a different page. For example, "Search results (page 1&nbsp;of&nbsp;4)".</p>
  <p>Show an appropriate number of pages to fit the horizontal space available.</p> 
  <p>For smaller screens, show page numbers for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the current page</li>
    <li>previous and next pages</li>
    <li>1st and last pages</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For larger screens, show page numbers for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the current page</li>
    <li>at least 1 page immediately before and after the current page</li>
    <li>1st and last pages</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use ellipses (…) to replace any skipped pages. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>[1]</strong> 2 … 100</li>
    <li>1 <strong>[2]</strong> 3 … 100</li>
    <li>1 2 <strong>[3]</strong> 4 … 100</li>
    <li>1 2 3 <strong>[4]</strong> 5 … 100</li>
    <li>1 … 4 <strong>[5]</strong> 6 … 100</li>
    <li>1 … 97 <strong>[98]</strong> 99 100</li>
    <li>1 … 98 <strong>[99]</strong> 100</li>
    <li>1 … 99 <strong>[100]</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="1st-and-last-pages">1st and last pages</h4>
  <p>Do not show the previous page link on the 1st page and do not show the next page link on the last page.</p>
  <p>ADD EXAMPLES</p>

  <h4 id="filtering-and-sorting">Filtering and sorting</h4>
  <p>Consider adding filtering or sorting options if it helps users to find what they need in a long list of pages. For example, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/business-finance-support">the business support finder on GOV.UK</a> has filtering options.</p>
  <p>If the user filters or sorts the list of pages, apply this to the whole list (not just the current page) and redirect them back to the 1st page of the new results.</p>
  <p>Set defaults to minimise how many pages most users have to click through to find what they need.</p>

  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
  <p class="rich-text">The pagination components are surrounded by a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element to show that they are navigation links. This element has an <code>aria-label</code> attribute with the value <code>Pagination</code>. Screen readers that support this attribute will read this.</p>
  <p class="rich-text">There is also a visually hidden heading title <code>pagination</code> which will be read by screen readers as a heading to the links. </p>
  <p class="rich-text">If the link describes the current page that you are on, then it has the <code>aria-current="page"</code> value to indicate to screen readers that this is the case.</p>

  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>We tested content page pagination in grouped information pages in 3 labs in summer 2018. We have not tested it in forms.</p>
  <p>In a user research lab, 4 out of 5 users, including a user with a very low level of digital skill, used pagination to navigate through the pages. They understood that it was associated with the navigation at the top of the page.</p>
  <p>Users found that the pagination reflected the way they read content and their mental model of the structure of the content. </p>
