  <h2 id="when-to-use-this-component">When to use a fieldset</h2>
  <p>Use a fieldset when you need to show a relationship between multiple form inputs. For example, to group a set of text inputs into a single fieldset when asking for an address or <a href="/design-system/components/date-input">a date</a>.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "fieldset",
    type: "default"
  }) }}

  <h2 id="how-it-works">How to use a fieldset</h2>
  <p class="rich-text">The 1st element in a fieldset must be a <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> which describes the group of inputs. This could be a question, such as "What is your address?" or a statement like "Personal details".</p>
  <p class="rich-text">If you are asking just <a href="/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/get-the-questions-into-order#begin-prototyping-with-1-thing-per-page">1 question per page</a> as we recommend, you can set the contents of the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> as the page heading. You can see an example below. This is good practice as it means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    group: "components",
    item: "fieldset",
    type: "as-heading"
  }) }}

  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
  <p>On question pages containing a set of inputs, group them using a <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> and include the question as the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code>. This helps screen reader users understand that the inputs are all related to that question.</p>
  <p>Include any important general help text in the legend if it would help the user fill in the form, and you cannot write it as <a href="/design-system/components/text-input#using-hint-text">hint text</a>. Keep it as short as possible because screen readers may repeat the legend for each input in the fieldset.</p>
