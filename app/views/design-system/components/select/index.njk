  <p>WCAG 2.2: Make sure that users can successfully <a href="#wcag-avoid-dragging-multiple-options">use select without relying on click and drag movements</a> (if you add functionality to select multiple options).</p>

  <h2 id="how-it-works">How to use select</h2>
  <p>The select component allows users to choose an option from a long list. Before using it, try other questions which will allow you to present users with fewer options. Consider using a different solution, such as <a href="/design-system/components/radios">radios</a>.</p>

  <p>Any input that's designed to let a user select multiple options must offer a way to do so without relying on click and drag movements or keyboard and mouse combination actions. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.5.7 Dragging Movements (W3C)</a>.</p>

  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>User research shows that some users struggle with the select component, especially people who use a keyboard to navigate and people with motor difficulties. The dropdown feature makes users work hard to see and understand their options and click the option they want.</p>
  <h3>Known issues and gaps</h3>
  <p>Research shows that users can struggle with selects, particularly when users have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>been unable to close the select</li>
    <li>tried to type into the select</li>
    <li>confused focused items with selected items</li>
    <li>tried to pinch zoom select options on smaller devices</li>
    <li>not understood that they can scroll down to see more items, or how to</li>
  </ul>
