  <h2 id="include-the-nhsuk-frontend-in-your-project">Include the NHS.UK frontend in your project</h2>
  <p>To start using the NHS website styles, components and patterns, you’ll need to include the NHS.UK frontend in your project.</p>
  <p>There are 2 ways to include the NHS.UK frontend. You can either install it using node package manager (npm) or include the compiled files in your application.</p>

  <h3 id="option-1-install-using-npm">Option 1: install using npm</h3>
  <p>We recommend <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md">installing the NHS.UK frontend using npm</a>.</p>
  <p>Using this option, you will be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>selectively include the CSS or JavaScript for individual components</li>
    <li>build your own styles or components based on the palette or typography and spacing mixins</li>
    <li>customise the build (for example, overriding colours or enabling global styles)</li>
    <li>use the component Nunjucks templates</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="option-2-include-compiled-files">Option 2: include compiled files</h3>
  <p>If your project does not use npm, or if you want to try out the NHS.UK frontend in your project without installing it through npm, you can <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-compiled.md">download and include compiled stylesheets, JavaScript and the asset files</a>.</p>
  <p>Using this option, you will be able to include all the CSS and JavaScript of the NHS.UK frontend in your project.</p>
  <p>You will not be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>selectively include the CSS or JavaScript for individual components</li>
    <li>build your own styles or components based on the palette or typography and spacing mixins</li>
    <li>customise the build, for example, overriding colours or enabling global styles</li>
    <li>use the component Nunjucks templates</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="styling-page-elements">Styling page elements</h2>
  <p>The service manual provides CSS classes for styling content, instead of global styles.</p>
  <p>The class names follow the Block Element Modifier (BEM) naming convention. This can look a bit daunting at first, but it makes robust code that's easy to maintain.</p>
  <p>Explore the <a href="/design-system/styles/">Styles</a> section of the service manual to see what classes are available.</p>

  <h2 id="using-components">Using components</h2>
  <p>The <a href="/design-system/components/">components</a> in the service manual are designed to be accessible and responsive. There are 2 ways to implement them in your application.</p>
  <p>You can either use HTML or, if you're using Nunjucks with node.js and you installed the NHS.UK frontend using npm, you can use a Nunjucks Macro.</p>
  <p>You can get the code from the HTML or Nunjucks tabs below the examples on our component pages, like this example of a button.</p>

  {{ designExample({
    type: 'button'
  }) }}

  <h3 id="using-nunjucks-macros">Using Nunjucks macros</h3>
  <p>A Nunjucks macro is a simple template that generates more complex HTML.</p>
  <p>Nunjucks macros save you time by managing repetitive or error-prone tasks, like linking form labels to their controls.</p>
  <p>Nunjucks macros also make it easier to keep your application up to date. You can run a command to update component code instead of having to manually update your HTML.</p>
  <p>To use Nunjucks macros in your application, you’ll need to setup Nunjucks views to point to the location of NHS.UK frontend components, which is <code>node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/</code>.</p>
  <p>To include a specific component macro in your page template, you need to import the macro.</p>
  <p>For example, to use the button macro, use the import statement <code>% from 'node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/button/macro.njk' import button %}</code>.</p>

  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text nhsuk-u-margin-top-5">
    <p>If you’re using Nunjucks macros in production, be aware that using  <code>html</code> arguments or ones ending with <code>html</code> can be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">security risk</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>There are various way to mitigate against this. An example is described in the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html#user-defined-templates-warning">Nunjucks documentation</a>.</p>
