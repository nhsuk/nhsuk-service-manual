<h2 id="when-to-use">When to use a product page</h2>

<p>Use a product page if you have a service which is for NHS staff, or a service used as a platform or API on which other services are built.</p>

<p>The page should help users find your service, understand what it does, and how to get started using it.</p>

<p>Do not use a product page for patient-facing services. Those services should use a <a href="/design-system/patterns/start-page">start page</a> on the NHS website instead.</p>

<p>The product page should be the signed-out page for your service, from which users can log in. Users can also be returned to the product page after logging out.</p>

<h2>What to include on a product page</h2>

<p>You should do research with your users (and potential users) to understand what information would help them decide whether to use your service.</p>

<p>You could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a short description of what the service does and who it is for</li>
  <li>benefits of using the service</li>
  <li>an illustration</li>
  <li>how to get started</li>
  <li>a step by step summary of how it works</li>
  <li>some stats on usage of your service</li>
  <li>support and contact information</li>
  <li>a roadmap of features recently added and planned for the future</li>
  <li>links to any guidance or further documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>The blue section at the top uses a <a href="/design-system/components/buttons">reversed button</a> for the primary action. For example this could be to sign up, to log in, or to find out more.</p>

<p>Add additional sections below the blue section as needed. These could have blue, grey or white backgrounds.</p>
