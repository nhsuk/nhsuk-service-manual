      <p>AMD affects the middle part of your vision, not the edges (peripheral vision).</p>
      <p>You can get it in one eye or both.</p>

      <p>AMD can make things like reading, watching TV, driving or recognising faces difficult.</p>

      <p>Other symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>seeing straight lines as wavy or crooked</li>
        <li>objects looking smaller than normal</li>
        <li>colours seeming less bright than they used to</li>
        <li>seeing things that aren't there (hallucinations)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>AMD isn't painful and doesn't affect the appearance of your eyes.</p>
