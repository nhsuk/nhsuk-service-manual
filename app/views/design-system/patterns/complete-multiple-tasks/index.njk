<p>Help users understand:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the tasks involved in completing a transaction</li>
  <li>whether they've completed tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>WCAG 2.2: Make sure that users can successfully <a href="#wcag-interact-without-click-drag-task">interact with tasks without relying on click and drag movements</a> (if you choose to add functionality to reorder tasks). And <a href="#wcag-edit-information-previous-task">edit information they have given when going back to a previous task</a>.</p>

{{ designExample({
  group: "patterns",
  item: "complete-multiple-tasks",
  type: "example"
}) }}

<p>This pattern uses a <a href="/design-system/components/task-list">task list component</a> for each group of tasks on the page.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-the-task-list">When to use this pattern</h2>
<p>If your users have to get through a long or complex service, use the complete multiple tasks page to give them more control. For example, if some users cannot complete the tasks in one sitting.</p>

<h2 id="when-not-to-use-the-task-list">When not to use this pattern</h2>
<p>Try to simplify the service before you use a complete multiple tasks page. If you're able to reduce the number of tasks or steps involved, you might not need one.</p>
<p>Do not use the complete multiple tasks page as a way of showing users their answers. For this, use a <a href="/design-system/components/summary-list/">summary list</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How this pattern works</h2>
<p>Show a complete multiple tasks page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>at the start of the transaction</li>
  <li>at the start of each returning session</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use a complete multiple tasks page in your service, you'll need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>group related actions into tasks</li>
  <li>show the status of the tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are lots of tasks to complete, you might also need to group tasks together.</p>

<h3 id="show-related-actions-as-a-task">Show related actions as a task</h3>
<p>Summarise a set of related activities and questions into a task, for example, "Give medical information". This will help users understand and plan what they need to do.</p>

<div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-interact-without-click-drag-task" role="note">
  <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
  <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">WCAG 2.2</strong>
  <p>Any task list that lets the user reorder the tasks must offer a way to do so without relying on click and drag movements. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.5.7 Dragging movements (W3C)</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="show-the-status-of-the-tasks">Show the status of the tasks</h3>
<p>Make it clear to users which tasks they have completed and which still need their attention, by labelling them using statuses.</p>

{{ designExample({
  group: "patterns",
  item: "complete-multiple-tasks",
  type: "task-list-statuses"
}) }}

<p>Start with the smallest number of different statuses you think might work, for example "Completed" and "Incomplete", then add more if your user research shows there's a need for them. The more you add, the harder it is for users to remember them.</p>
<p>Once the user has completed the task, show the status as "Completed" in black text with no background colour. This will draw more attention to tasks that require action.</p>

<h4 id="tasks-that-are-in-progress">Tasks that are in progress</h4>
<p>You may find you need additional statuses if your user research shows that users want to be able to distinguish between the tasks they have not started at all, and those they've started but not completed.</p>
<p>In this instance, instead of "Incomplete", you may want to use "Not yet started" to show which tasks they are yet to start. Use "In progress" for tasks they have started but are yet to complete.</p>

<p>"Not yet started" uses a light blue background, and "In progress" uses a white background.</p>

{{ designExample({
  group: "patterns",
  item: "complete-multiple-tasks",
  type: "in-progress"
}) }}

<h4 id="tasks-that-cannot-yet-be-started">Tasks that cannot yet be started</h4>

<p>If the user cannot start the task yet, for example because another task must be completed first, use the "Cannot start yet" status. Use grey text with no background colour, and do not link the "task row".</p>

{{ designExample({
  group: "patterns",
  item: "complete-multiple-tasks",
  type: "cannot-start-yet"
}) }}

<h4 id="tasks-containing-an-error">Tasks containing an error</h4>

<p>Avoid tasks having an error status by using the <a href="/design-system/components/error-summary/">error summary</a> and <a href="/design-system/components/error-message/">error messages</a> displayed at the point that the error is made, so that the user can fix it straight away.</p>

<p>If it is unavoidable that a task may end up saved but containing an error, use the status text "There is a problem" and a red background.</p>

<p>Do not use the red background colour for any status text except errors.</p>

{{ designExample({
  group: "patterns",
  item: "complete-multiple-tasks",
  type: "error"
}) }}

<h4 id="status-text">Status text</h4>

<p>Although we recommend using consistent wording across task lists, you can change it if research shows that different text is more suitable to your service or users.</p>

<p>If you are creating your own statuses, use adjectives rather than verbs. Use sentence case and keep it short, so that it can be easily read and understood.</p>

<h4 id="additional-statuses">Additional statuses</h4>

<p>If your user research shows that there is a need for additional status tags, you can use other colours to help distinguish between them.</p>

{{ designExample({
  group: "patterns",
  item: "complete-multiple-tasks",
  type: "all-colours"
}) }}

<h3 id="group-tasks-into-steps">Group related tasks together</h3>

<p>If your transaction involves lots of tasks, make it manageable by grouping them.</p>

<p>For example, you could group all tasks which ask for related information under a heading, such as "Your details".</p>

<p>Where possible, allow users to complete tasks in any order. This will help them plan their time and complete sections as and when they can.</p>

<h3 id="marking-tasks-as-completed">Marking tasks as completed</h3>

<p>Sometimes, it's better to let the user decide when a task is completed.</p>

<p>This can be helpful when a task involves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some questions that are optional</li>
  <li>writing a long answer (such as in a <a href="/design-system/components/textarea/">textarea</a>)</li>
  <li>looking up information, such as details about previous jobs</li>
  <li>answers that need to be checked carefully with someone else</li>
</ul>

<p>Do this by asking a radio question at the end of the task. If the task is on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a single page, do it as the last question</li>
  <li>on multiple question pages, do it on a <a href="/design-system/patterns/check-answers">check answers page</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Ask "Have you completed this section?" with the radio options "Yes, I've completed this section" or "No, I'll come back later".</p>

<p>If the user selects "No, I'll come back to it later", mark the task as "Incomplete" or "In progress".</p>

<p>If the user selects "Yes, I've completed this section", mark the task as "Completed".</p>

<div class="nhsuk-inset-text app-wcag-inset-text app-wcag-22" id="wcag-edit-information-previous-task" role="note">
  <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
  <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2">WCAG 2.2</strong>
  <p>If a user decides to go back to a previous task, make sure information they have already entered is pre-populated.</p>
<p>Do not pre-populate if the information is no longer valid, or when pre-populating would be a major safety or security concern. This is to comply with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/redundant-entry.html">WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.7 Redundant entry (W3C)</a>.</p>
</div>

{{ designExample({
  group: "patterns",
  item: "complete-multiple-tasks",
  type: "have-you-completed-this-section"
}) }}

<p>Always allow users to go back into a task to change their answer.</p>

<h4 id="error-messages">Error messages</h4>

<p>If the user does not select an option, show an <a href="/design-system/components/error-message/">error message</a> to say: "Select whether you've completed this section".</p>

{{ designExample({
  group: "patterns",
  item: "complete-multiple-tasks",
  type: "have-you-completed-this-section-error"
}) }}

<h2 id="research-on-this-pattern">Research on this pattern</h2>

<p>This pattern is based on the pattern in the GOV.UK design system.</p>
