  <p>Use these design styles, components and patterns to quickly make prototypes or build a live service.</p>

  <p>The examples in the NHS digital service manual come with code to make it easy for you to use them in your project.</p>

  <h2>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</h2>
  <p>We have updated the design system to meet WCAG 2.2. <a href="/accessibility/wcag2-2">See a list of WCAG 2.2 updates</a>.</p>
  <p>Teams should comply now to make sure products and services are ready by October 2024. This is when the Government Digital Service, Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England will start monitoring accessibility to WCAG 2.2.</p>
