  <h2>WCAG 2.2</h2>
  <p>We are currently reviewing the design system and will be updating it to reflect <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG 2.2</a>.</p>
  <p>Teams should comply now to make sure products and services are ready by October 2024. This is when the Government Digital Service, Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England will start monitoring accessibility to WCAG 2.2.</p>
