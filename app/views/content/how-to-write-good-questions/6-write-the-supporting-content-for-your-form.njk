<p>You may need supporting content before, during and at the end of your questions.</p>
<h2>Introductions, instructions and other content before the form</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you haven't already done so, name your form. (See the GOV.UK guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service">Naming your service</a>.)</li>
  <li>Introduce and explain the form. Who is it for and when should they fill it in? Say what the form does in your users' words. This is your chance to stop the wrong people filling in the form.</li>
  <li>Set expectations. For example, give users some idea what they will need in order to fill it in. Do they need any form of identity, such as their NHS number? If you're going to let people check their answers at the end, let them know this early on.</li>
</ul>
  <h3>Be careful with start pages</h3>
  <p>People usually want to get to the questions quickly. They often ignore text, including instructions, and miss any information under the Start button (and any Continue buttons).</p>
  <p>Because of this, rather than explaining eligibility criteria, it's often better to check eligibility as part of the form.</p>

<p>If you have any introductory content, make sure that you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>keep it brief</li>
  <li>make it easy for users to scan the page, select an action and move on</li>
  <li>use headings to break your content into smaller chunks - users may at least read the headings</li>
  <li>consider instead giving users help text where they need it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="help-text-error-messages-and-guidance-in-the-form">Help text, error messages and guidance in the form</h2>
<h3>Help text</h3>
<p>Put just enough help text where users need it - and only if you see in research that your users need it.</p>
<p>For example, users do not usually need to be told to "Select the answer that applies to you" with <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/radios">radios</a> but they may need telling to "Select all the options that are relevant to you" with <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/checkboxes">checkboxes</a>.</p>

<p>Answer users' questions like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"What's this?"</li>
  <li>"Why do you want this information?"</li>
  <li>"Where can I find this?"</li>
</ul>
<p>Use it, for example, to explain things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>any necessary jargon</li>
  <li>where to find their NHS number</li>
  <li>what format users should give information in</li>
  <li>what you’ll do with personal information</li>
  <li>the consequences of making 1 choice over another</li>
</ul>
<p>Good help text will save having to write <a href="#error-messages">error messages</a>.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that users may miss the help text. Sometimes a <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions/5-use-filter-questions-but-be-careful">filter question</a> will work better.</p>

<p>Remember, if you’re having to explain your interface, it needs more work.</p>

<h4>How to add help text</h4>
<p>We don't recommend tool tips. Instead you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>add <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/hint-text">hint text</a> inline, immediately next to the question it relates to, for help that's relevant to most of your users</li>
  <li>use the <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/details">details component</a> to reveal expanding help text - this is useful if the help text is only relevant for some users</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="error-messages">Error messages</h3>
<p>Be concise and specific. You do not need to say "please". Focus on telling the user how to fix the problem rather than describing what’s gone wrong.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/error-message">error messages</a> and <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/error-summary">error summaries</a> in the service manual.</p>
<p>The GOV.UK design system has good <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/#be-clear-and-concise">guidance on writing error messages</a>, including <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/#use-error-message-templates">error message templates for common errors</a>.</p>
<p>You may need to write more than 1 error message for each field.</p>
<h3>Longer guidance</h3>
<p>Ooccasionally you will need to give users more detailed guidance to help them make particularly complex or difficult decisions. But most users probably won't read more than a few lines. Try help text before you write fuller guidance. Keep it brief.</p>

<h2>Confirmation or thank you pages at the end of the form</h2>
<p>The content you write at the end of the form will depend on how your form ends: for example, with a <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/">summary list</a> to let users check their answers. </p>
<p>You will probably need a confirmation or thank you page.</p>

<p>Make it clear:</p>
<ul>
  <li>that the user has completed the form successfully - see the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/confirmation-pages/">GOV.UK confirmation page</a>, for example</li>
  <li>when they will get an answer if they don’t get one straightaway</li>
  <li>what, if anything else, will happen next</li>
  <li>if need be, how they can get in touch or where they can get other help if there's likely to be a wait, for example signpost to support services</li>
  <li>how they can change their form or information</li>
  <li>how they can find out more about how you store and manage their information</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other content</h2>
<p>Think beyond the form. For the user, it is likely to be a cross-channel experience. Remember to make your on and offline content consistent, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>paper or downloadable forms</li>
  <li>introductory emails or letters</li>
  <li>any confirmation emails or text messages</li>
  <li>call centre scripts</li>
  <li>follow up emails or letters</li>
</ul>
<h2>Read more about writing content for transactions</h2>
<p>GOV.UK has some good guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/govuk-content-transactions">designing how GOV.UK content and transactions work together</a>.</p>
