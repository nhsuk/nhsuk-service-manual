<p>Keep, cut, postpone, explain - if you follow this mantra, it'll help you work out which questions to include.</p>

  <h2>Keep</h2>
  <p>If you’re asking for answers that you definitely need and your users are eager to give you them, keep those questions.</p>
  <p>For example, if your users are signing up for a newsletter, they are usually happy to give you their email address.</p>
  <h2>Cut out</h2>
  <p>If you’re asking for answers that you don’t need right now - or you don’t know how you'll use the information, remove the question.</p>
  <h3 id="understand-why-you're-asking-each-question">Understand why you're asking each question</h3>

<p>Make a list of all the information you need from your users. (This is sometimes called a "question protocol".) This process forces you to question why you're asking users for each item of information and allows you to challenge unnecessary questions.</p>
<p>Only include a question if you know:</p>
<ul>
  <li>that you need the information to deliver the service</li>
  <li>why you need it</li>
  <li>who in the organisation uses the information and how</li>
  <li>which users need to give you the information</li>
  <li>how you'll check that the information is accurate - and your validation rules</li>
  <li>what you'll do if the user gives you the wrong answer or no answer</li>
  <li>how you'll keep the information up to date and secure - and can get specialist advice on protecting users' confidentiality and privacy</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="start-with-essential-questions">Start with essential questions and add optional ones later</h3>
<p>You should only be asking for information you need to provide the service. Decide if each question is essential (sometimes called "required" or "mandatory") or not. </p>
<p>There are 4 kinds of questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>essential questions - the user can't get the service unless they give you this information</li>
  <li>not essential, but helpful - on a feedback form, for example, if the user wants a reply, they may give you their contact details but not if they just want to send you feedback</li>
  <li>not essential or helpful to the organisation, but important to the user - for example, the user may want to tell you their story</li>
  <li>neither essential nor helpful - leave these out</li>
</ul>

  <p>Only add helpful (optional) questions if your users seem to need them.</p>
  <p>Mark optional fields with "(optional)". Do not mark essential fields with asterisks.</p>


  <h3>Use information your organisation already has</h3>
  <p>For example, if you already have some data about the user, you may only need them to confirm that it's correct.</p>
  <p>[Looking for an example. BSA had a good example of using the NHS number.]</p>
 <h3>Be clear about signatures and declarations</h3>
  <p>Paper forms often ask for a signature but not many organisations authenticate them. Does your service need a signature and if so, how does it check the user's identity? </p>

  <p>Sometimes the value of the declaration is that it signals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>that you're asking users to commit to give careful, honest answers</li>
    <li>that they've ready to hand their information or application over to your service to take the next step</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Before you include a signature or declaration, find out what your users expect and understand by it.</p>
  <p>If you have to verify and authenticate individuals, read <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb3051-identity-verification-and-authentication-standard-for-digital-health-and-care-services">Identity verification and authentication standard for digital health and care services</a>, DCB3051 (NHS Digital).</p>

  <h2>Postpone</h2>
  <p>If you could ask it later, postpone your question. Ask for the minimum information your service needs to make a decision and consider collecting other information afterwards.</p>
<details class="nhsuk-details" open="">
  <summary class="nhsuk-details__summary">
    <span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text">
      Examples
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <ul>
      <li>If the person has a broken leg, you don’t need to ask their sex.</li>
      <li>On an application form, first ask the questions that let you and the user know if they're eligible, then come back to questions that determine what they will get.</li>
      <li>For psychological therapies, do not ask your users to take a clinical assessment (like a depression score sheet) as part of their self-referral form - ask them to fill it in later on.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>
  <h2>Explain</h2>
  <p>If it’s a difficult question that your users don’t want to answer (for example, you’re asking for personal data) or it’s something that needs research or extra thought, explain why you need to ask and how it will help you help them. (If there’s no benefit to the user, do you need to ask it?)<p>

  <h3 id="consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions">Consider the sensitivities around your questions</h3>
<p>Users may be reluctant to answer questions that ask for sensitive information or for information that seems inappropriate. They will happily give you their postcode to find a local pharmacy but they may be reluctant to give you their name and date of birth if they do not think it's relevant.</p>
<p>If you <a href="#understand-why-you're-asking-each-question">understand why you're asking each question</a> and how you will use the answer, you can explain it to the user. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tell users that the questions you're asking will help you know if their situation is urgent</li>
  <li>if your service collections some information only for statistics and will anonymise it, say so</li>
</ul>

<p>Topics that are especially sensitive are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sex observed and noted at birth or biological sex</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
  <li>whether or not the person has children or intends to have children</li>
  <li>whether or not they are married, in a partnership, or living with someone</li>
  <li>whether or not they have mental health problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Other questions under the Equalities Act may be sensitive.</p>

<p>Some people are reluctant to divulge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>their true age - they may have lied about it before</li>
  <li>their email address - they may be afraid of spam</li>
  <li>their telephone or mobile number - they may be afraid it’ll be used inappropriately</li>
</ul>

<p>Another way to deal with sensitive questions is to ask a different question. For example, people may be more willing to give you their age range.</p>
<p>Sometimes "Other" is a useful option, but be careful about using it with personal data or sensitive topics. It can make people feel that you don't care enough about their personal circumstances to be specific.</p>
<p>Consider what you'll do if the user won't answer the question.</p>

<p>There is more guidance on asking users for different kinds of information in the GOV.UK design system:</p>

  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/">dates</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/telephone-numbers/">telephone numbers</a></li>
</ul>

  <p>Remember, if you do not know how your service will use the answer, do not ask the question.</p>
