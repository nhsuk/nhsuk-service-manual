    <p>It's a form if it:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>looks and works like a form - you need to make it easy to read and easy to use (interaction design)</li>
      <li>asks questions and expects people to give an answer - make the questions easy to understand and answer (content design)</li>
      <li>lets someone achieve a goal - make it easy for them to get things done and move on (service design)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Form design and this guidance</h2>

    <p>Forms need to work across all 3 layers.</p>
    <p>This guidance focuses on the questions and on content design for forms (no. 3).</p>
    <p>Later this year, we will be working on guidance to help you build the form (interaction design - no. 1).</p>
    <p>You should also think about service design (no. 3). The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/introduction-designing-government-services">GOV.UK guidance on "Designing good government services: an introduction"</a> is a good place to start.</p>
