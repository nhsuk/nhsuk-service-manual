    {% include 'content/how-to-write-good-questions/write-good-questions-nav.njk' %}

    <p>This guidance will help you understand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>which questions to include</li>
      <li>how to write them well</li>
      <li>how to write other content for your form or transaction, for example: introductions, instructions, help text, error messages and confirmation pages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is a form?</h2>
    <p>It's a form if it:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>looks and works like a form - you need to make it easy to read and easy to use (interaction design)</li>
      <li>asks questions and expects people to give an answer - make the questions easy to understand and answer (content design)</li>
      <li>lets someone achieve a goal - make it easy for them to get things done and move on (service design)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Form design and this guidance</h2>
    <p>Forms need to work across all 3 layers.</p>
    <p>This guidance focuses on the questions and on content design for forms (layer 2).</p>
    <p>Later this year, we will be working on guidance to help you build the form (interaction design - layer 1).</p>
    <p>Think about service design (layer 3) too. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/introduction-designing-government-services">GOV.UK guidance on "Designing good government services: an introduction"</a> is a good place to start.</p>

    <h2>Community</h2>
    <p>A lot of people have helped us with this guidance.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Caroline Jarrett, an expert in forms design, was our subject matter expert and the guidance reflects, for example, her 3 layers of a form model and her "Keep, Cut, Postpone, Explain" mantra.</li>
      <li>We've tested the guidance with a number of digital teams in the NHS and have learnt from their work.</li>
      <li>We've built on the GOV.UK service manual and the GDS design system.</li>
      <li>We've used Tourangeau, Rips and Rasinski's model of how people respond to survey questions.</li>
    </ul>
