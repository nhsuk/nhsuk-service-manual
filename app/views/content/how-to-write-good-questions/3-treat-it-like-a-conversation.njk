  <h2>Build trust</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't rush things. Ask for information at the appropriate time. Read more about <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions/2-make-sure-you-need-each-question#consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions">considering the sensitivities around your questions</a>.</li>

    <li>Offer prompts and help: on the web, on phone or in person.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Use brief, clear language that users understand</h2>
  <ul>
       <li>Use your users' words. Listen to them to get an idea of the language they use: for example, (high) "blood pressure", not "hypertension".</li>
    <li>Do not hide behind the passive tense. Not "Your GP will be notified' but "We will let your GP know".</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Follow the service manual <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/content">content style guide</a> and the <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/accessibility/content">guidance on accessibility and content</a>.<p>
  <p>For page titles you can use either a question or a statement. For example, "What is your date of birth?" or just "Date of birth".</p>
  <h2>Be less formal</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Soften your language. Instead of "You must confirm this", ask them to "Please confirm this".</li>
    <li>Do not ask for their "Full name", for example, if you just need their "Name" or "Contact name".</li>
    <li>Ask them for the information the way you would in person.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Make it flow</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Think about how the questions flow and whether they're grouped in a way that makes sense to the user. Section 3 explains how to <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions/3-get-the-questions-into-order">get the questions into order</a>.</li>
    <li>Word questions or statements consistently. This helps users get into a rhythm of answering and lets them focus on the content of the questions rather than how they’re presented.</li>
    <li>It's OK to ask a follow up question. For example: "We think you mean this. Is that right?"</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Think about who's filling in the form	</h2>
  <p>Bear in mind that the person filling in the form might be the user, or a family member, carer or some other person helping the user. How might this affect your questions?</p>
  <p>For example, if you’re offering a callback service, rather than asking for "your" phone number or "their" phone number, ask "What number do you want us to call you on?"</p>
  <p>If someone may be filling in the form for someone else, that may change how appropriate the question is.</p>

  <h2>Ask questions that users can answer easily</h2>
  <p>Closed questions are usually easier than open ones (but <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions/5-be-careful-with-yes-no-questions">be careful with Yes No questions</a>). Several short questions are often easier than 1 long one.</p>

  <h3 id="consider-the-effort-involved-in-answering">Consider the effort involved in answering</h3>
  <p>There are increasing levels of difficulty involved, depending on whether users will get the answer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>from their heads</li>
    <li>from information they have to hand</li>
    <li>by asking someone else - for example, arranging a witness or referee</li>
    <li>by figuring something out</li>
  </ul>

<p>Users often have problems figuring things out. Here’s an example of a difficult question:</p>

<p>"What percentage of your working day do you spend doing moderate-intensity activities that cause
small increases in breathing or heart rate (such as brisk walking or carrying light loads) for at least 10 minutes continuously?"</p>

<p>To answer a question like this, the user has to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>understand the question</li>
  <li>think back or go and check things</li>
  <li>make a decision or estimate (some people find calculations like percentages difficult)</li>
  <li>answer the question</li>
</ul>
<p>They may guess or give up.</p>
