    <h2>Things you need to understand</h2>
    <p>Make sure that your team understands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>your users' needs and their accessibility challenges</li>
      <li>your different user groups and how your decisions will affect them</li>
      <li>the purpose and context of the form</li>
      <li>how your service collects information now</li>
      <li>the wider user journey and the service (and processes) around the form</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your team should also have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>tested any existing forms - watch users fill them in and watch staff deal with the answers (read more about <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions/7-test-your-questions">testing the questions</a>)</li>
      <li>talked about technology options - at least some initial discussions</li>
      <li>decided how you'll measure success</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If it's not possible to do a proper discovery</h2>
    <p>Good questions start with a good discovery. It's difficult to get them right without it. But if you can't do a discovery before you start, you can still improve your form.
    <p>Get members of the team to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>choose 1 or more personas</li>
      <li>role play and fill in the form as the persona, as honestly as they can</li>
      <li>talk about the issues they found, thinking about the 3 layers of the form (See the <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions/introduction-what-is-a-form">Introduction: What is a form?</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This exercise may help you identify areas to prioritise. Do your user research and test your assumptions. (Read more about <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions/7-test-your-questions">testing your questions</a>.)</p>
