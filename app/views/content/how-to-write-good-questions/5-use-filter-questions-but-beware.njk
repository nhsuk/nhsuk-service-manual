      <p class="nhsuk-body-l nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-8">Sometimes extra filter (or branching) questions improve users' experience. Filter questions, including Yes No questions, can help you route users to the questions that apply to them. But there are some things to bear in mind.</p>

<h3>Use filter (or branching) questions</h3>
  <p>Filter questions ask a short question first - often a Yes No question. They let you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>simplify long questions</li>
    <li>avoid optional questions - in other words, users only answer questions that apply to them</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You may not need to collect answers to filter questions.</p>
  <p>But <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions/5-be-careful-with-yes-no-questions">be careful with Yes No questions</a>.</p>


<h2>Beware binary choices</h2>
<p>There are often more options than you think. For example, instead of asking "Do you know your NHS number?" with a Yes No answer, you might word it: "Can you find your NHS number?"</p>
<p>And the answers might be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yes, I have it</li>
  <li>I can find it</li>
  <li>I have 1, but I can't find it</li>
  <li>I don't think I have 1</li>
  <li>I don't know</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes you can test this by leaving a space for people to type in.</p>
<h2>Ask 1 question at a time</h2>
<p>Make sure you're asking 1 question at a time - not 2 questions in 1.</p>
<p>Here's an example of 2 in 1: “If you have an email address, can we contact you about research?”


<h2>Be clear what "Yes" and "No" mean</h2>
<p>Rather than simply offering "Yes" or "No" options, be clear, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Yes, you can contact me by email about research"</li>
  <li>"No, do not contact me about research"</li>
</ul>
<p>In a simple Yes No question, "No" could also mean:<p>
<ul>
  <li>"No, do not contact me by email"</li>
  <li>"No, do not contact me at all"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Let users answer "I don't know" or "I'm not sure"</h2>

<p>In the example above, users might want to say:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"I don't understand the question"</li>
  <li>"I only want to know about x research"</li>
</ul>

<p>You could include alternatives like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Other</li>
  <li>Not sure because ...</li>
  <li>Something else</li>
</ul>
