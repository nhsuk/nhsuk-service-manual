    <h2 id="what-are-filter-questions">What are "filter" questions?</h2>

       <p>Filter (or branching) questions ask a short question first - often a Yes No question like this, with <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/radios">radios</a>. </p>

      {{ radios({
        "idPrefix": "example",
        "name": "example",
        "fieldset": {
          "legend": {
            "text": "Are you 18 or over?",
            "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
          }
        },
        "items": [
          {

          }
        ]
      }) }}
    </div>
    <p>Filter questions help you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>get people to the questions that apply to them - so use them early on</li>
      <li>avoid optional questions, because users only answer the questions that apply to them</li>
      <li>simplify long questions by breaking them up</li>
    </ul>

     <img class="nhsuk-image__img nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7" src="/service-manual/assets/binary-question-long.png" alt="">

    <p>But often you need more than a simple Yes or No.</p>

  <h2>Spell out what "Yes" and "No" mean</h2>
  <p>Sometimes you need to be clearer about what "Yes" and "No" mean.</p>
  <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
      <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
      {{ radios({
        "idPrefix": "example",
        "name": "example",
        "fieldset": {
          "legend": {
            "text": "Can we email you about research?",
            "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
          }
        },
        "items": [
          {
            "value": "yes",
            "text": "Yes, you can contact me by email about research"
          },
          {
            "value": "no",
            "text": "No, do not contact me about research"
          }
        ]
      }) }}
    </div>


    <p>For example, "No" could also mean:<p>
    <ul>
      <li>"No, do not contact me by email"</li>
      <li>"No, do not contact me at all"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Or you may need to offer people guidance or an explanation to help them choose.</p>
    <h2>Beware binary choices</h2>
    <p>There will often be at least 1 other option besides Yes and No, including, for example, "I don't know" or "I'm not sure". </p>

    <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
      <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
      {{ radios({
        "idPrefix": "example",
        "name": "example",
        "fieldset": {
          "legend": {
            "text": "Do you know your NHS number?",
            "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
          }
        },
        "items": [
          {
            "value": "yes",
            "text": "Yes, I know my NHS number"
          },
          {
            "value": "no",
            "text": "No, I do not know my NHS number"
          },
          {
            "value": "unsure",
            "text": "I'm not sure"
          }
        ]
      }) }}
    </div>

    <p>Having the 3rd option means that you can give people some extra help with finding their number.</p>
    <p>Sometimes "Other" is a useful option, but <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions#think-before-you-use-other">be careful of using "Other" with personal or sensitive information</a>.</p>
    <p>If you're drafting a Yes No question, it can help to test it by leaving a space for people to type in something different.</p>



  <h2>Offer people other ways to do things</h2>
     <p>If you need people to enter details to continue with their online journey and they can't do this, for example, because they don't have key informaton to hand, consider whether you could add information to the "No" option to reassure them that there is an alternative.</p>
     <p>For example: "No, try another way".</p>
