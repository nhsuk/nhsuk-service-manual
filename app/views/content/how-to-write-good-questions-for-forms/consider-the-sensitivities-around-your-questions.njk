    <h2>Understand the topics that are especially sensitive</h2>
    <p>These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>gender or sex</li>
      <li>sexual orientation</li>
      <li>whether or not the person has children or intends to have children</li>
      <li>whether or not they are married, in a partnership, or living with someone</li>
      <li>whether or not they have mental health problems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other questions under the Equalities Act may be sensitive.</p>

    <p>Some people are reluctant to divulge:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>their true age</li>
      <li>their email address</li>
      <li>their telephone or mobile number</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Think about what you'll do if the user can't or won't answer the question.</p>

   <h2>Consider the context</h2>
   <p>It's OK to ask what sex someone is when you need the information to provide the right medical care, but often it's irrelevant.</p>
   <p>Take into account who will be involved in filling in the form. Will the user want to divulge the information to a family member?</p>

    <h2>Try asking a different question</h2>

    <p>Another way to deal with sensitive questions is to ask a different question. For example, people may be more willing to give you their age range.</p>

<h2>Explain why you need to ask</h2>
    <p>If you <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/make-sure-you-need-each-question#understand-why-you're-asking-each-question">understand why you're asking each question</a> and how you will use the answer, you can explain it to users. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>tell users that the questions you're asking will help you know if their situation is urgent</li>
      <li>if your service collections some information only for statistics and will anonymise it, say so</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="think-before-you-use-other">Think before you use "Other"</h2>
<p>Be wary of using "Other" when you're collecting personal data or sensitive topics. It can make people feel that you don't care enough about their personal circumstances to be specific.</p>

  <p>Be especially careful with "Other" or "Mixed" ethnicity in the context of health information. Do not use these categories to provide health information.</p>â€‹
