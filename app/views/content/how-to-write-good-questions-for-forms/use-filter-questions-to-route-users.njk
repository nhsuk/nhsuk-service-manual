  <h2 id="what-are-filter-questions">What are filter questions?</h2>
  <p>Filter (or branching) questions ask a short question first, often a Yes/No question, with <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/radios">radios</a>. A typical filter question would be: "Are you 18 or over?"</p>
  <p>Filter questions help you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>get people to the questions that apply to them - so use them early on</li>
    <li>avoid optional questions, because users only answer the questions that apply to them</li>
    <li>simplify long questions (like <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/get-the-questions-into-order#watch-out-for-double-barrelled-questions">"double-barrelled" questions</a>) by breaking them up</li>
  </ul>

  <img class="nhsuk-image__img nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7" src="/service-manual/assets/filter-question-example.png" alt="A filter question routing some users down a different journey">

  <p>But often you need more than a simple "Yes" or "No". In the "Are you 18 or over?" example, for instance, you should think about what your service can offer younger users as an alternative and how you can support their user journey.</p>

  <h2>Spell out what "Yes" and "No" mean</h2>
  <p>Check how users react to your Yes/No question when you test it. Sometimes you will find you need to be clearer about what "Yes" and "No" mean.</p>
  <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    {{ radios({
      "idPrefix": "example",
      "name": "example",
      "fieldset": {
        "legend": {
          "text": "Can we email you about research?",
          "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
        }
      },
      "items": [
        {
          "value": "yes",
          "text": "Yes, you can contact me by email about research"
        },
        {
          "value": "no",
          "text": "No, do not contact me about research"
        }
      ]
    }) }}
  </div>

  <p>In this case, "No" could also mean:<p>
  <ul>
    <li>"No, do not contact me by email"</li>
    <li>"No, do not contact me at all"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may need to offer people guidance or an explanation to help them choose.</p>

  <h2 id="beware-binary-choices">Beware binary choices</h2>
  <p>There will often be at least 1 other option besides "Yes" and "No", including, for example, "I don't know" or "I'm not sure".</p>
  <p>We recommend that you always try out a 3rd option. Extra options can be challenging for the service, but you should consider them.</p>

  <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>

    {% call fieldset({
      legend: {
        "text": "Do you know your NHS number?",
        "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
      }
      }) %}
      {{ hint({
        "text": "Your NHS number is a 10 digit number, like 485 777 3456.",
        "classes": "nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2"
      }) }}
      {{ hint({
        "text": "You can find this on any letter the NHS has sent you, on a prescription or by logging in to a GP practice online service."
      }) }}
      {{ radios({
        "idPrefix": "example-divider",
        "name": "configStructure",
        "items": [
      {
        "value": "yes",
        "text": "Yes, I know my NHS number"
      },
      {
        "value": "no",
        "text": "No, I do not know my NHS number"
      },
      {
        "value": "unsure",
        "text": "I'm not sure"
      }
    ]
    }) }}
    {% endcall %}
  </div>

  <p>Having a 3rd option means that you can give people extra information, for example, about their NHS number and where to find it. Our pattern for <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/nhs-number">asking users for their NHS number</a> explains more about this.</p>
  <p>"Other" can be a useful option, but <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions#think-before-you-use-other">avoid using "Other" with personal or sensitive information</a>.</p>
  <p>In your user research, find out what would help your users, for example, by leaving a box with hint text for them to type in something other than "Yes" or "No".</p>

  <h2 id="offer-people-other-ways-to-do-things">Offer people other ways to do things</h2>
  <p>If you need people to enter details to continue and they cannot do this, for example, because they do not have key information to hand, consider whether you could add something to the "No" option to reassure them that there is an alternative.</p>

  <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    {{ radios({
      "idPrefix": "example",
      "name": "example",
      "fieldset": {
        "legend": {
          "text": "Do you have your registration details?",
          "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
        }
      },
      "items": [
        {
          "value": "yes",
          "text": "Yes"
        },
        {
          "value": "no",
          "text": "No, try another way"
        }
      ]
    }) }}
  </div>

  <p>In our <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/nhs-number">Ask users for their NHS number pattern</a>, we recommend that you give users another way to complete the task without their NHS number. For example, by using a combination of other personal details, like their date of birth and postcode.</p>

  <h2>Test your questions and routing decisions</h2>
  <p>It can help to use post-its, or print out and cut up a paper prototype, to see how the answers might take users on 1 journey or another.</p>
  <p><a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/test-your-questions">Read more about testing your questions</a>.</p>
  <p>If a lot of people cannot answer "Yes" or "No", reconsider your question.</p>
