    <h2 id="what-are-filter-questions">What are filter questions?</h2>

    <p>Filter (or branching) questions ask a short question first - often a Yes/No question, with <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/radios">radios</a>. </p>
    <p>Here is a typical filter question.</p>

    <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
      <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
      {{ radios({
        "idPrefix": "example",
        "name": "example",
        "fieldset": {
          "legend": {
            "text": "Are you 18 or over?",
            "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
          }
        },
        "items": [
          {
            "value": "yes",
            "text": "Yes"
          },
          {
            "value": "no",
            "text": "No"
          }
        ]
      }) }}
    </div>

    <p>Filter questions help you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>get people to the questions that apply to them - so use them early on</li>
      <li>avoid optional questions, because users only answer the questions that apply to them</li>
      <li>simplify long questions (like <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/get-the-questions-into-order#watch-out-for-double-barrelled-questions">"double-barrelled" questions</a>) by breaking them up</li>
    </ul>

     <img class="nhsuk-image__img nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7" src="/service-manual/assets/filter-question-example.png" alt="A filter question routing some users down a different journey">

    <p>But often you need more than a simple "Yes" or "No".</p>
    <p>In the "Are you 18 or over?" example, for instance, what should users who are 17 years old do? Should you <a href="#offer-people-other-ways-to-do-things">offer them other ways to do things</a>?</p>

  <h2>Spell out what "Yes" and "No" mean</h2>
  <p>Check how users react to your Yes/No question when you test it. Sometimes you will find that you need to be clearer about what "Yes" and "No" mean.</p>
  <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
      <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
      {{ radios({
        "idPrefix": "example",
        "name": "example",
        "fieldset": {
          "legend": {
            "text": "Can we email you about research?",
            "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
          }
        },
        "items": [
          {
            "value": "yes",
            "text": "Yes, you can contact me by email about research"
          },
          {
            "value": "no",
            "text": "No, do not contact me about research"
          }
        ]
      }) }}
    </div>


    <p>In this case, "No" could also mean:<p>
    <ul>
      <li>"No, do not contact me by email"</li>
      <li>"No, do not contact me at all"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may need to offer people guidance or an explanation to help them choose.</p>
    <h2>Beware binary choices</h2>
    <p>There will often be at least 1 other option besides "Yes" and "No", including, for example, "I don't know" or "I'm not sure".</p>

    <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
      <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>

      {% call fieldset({
        legend: {
          "text": "Do you know your NHS number?",
          "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
        }
        }) %}
        {{ hint({
          "text": "Your NHS number is a 10 digit number, like 485 777 3456.",
          "classes": "nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-2"
        }) }}
        {{ hint({
          "text": "You can find this on any letter the NHS has sent you, on a prescription or by logging in to a GP practice online service."
        }) }}
        {{ radios({
          "idPrefix": "example-divider",
          "name": "configStructure",
          "items": [
        {
          "value": "yes",
          "text": "Yes, I know my NHS number"
        },
        {
          "value": "no",
          "text": "No, I do not know my NHS number"
        },
        {
          "value": "unsure",
          "text": "I'm not sure"
        }
      ]
      }) }}
      {% endcall %}
    </div>

    <p>Having the 3rd option means that you can give people some extra information, for example, about their NHS number and where to find it. Our pattern for <a href="http://localhost:3000/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/nhs-number">asking users for their NHS number</a> explains more about this.</p>

    <p>Sometimes "Other" is a useful option, but <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions#think-before-you-use-other">be careful of using "Other" with personal or sensitive information</a>.</p>
    <p>If you're drafting a Yes/No question, it can help to test it by leaving a box with hint text for people to type in something different.</p>

    <p>Extra options can be challenging for the service, but you should consider them. Our research for the NHS number pattern, for example, showed that a 3rd option was often useful in discovery and alpha stages, even if services did not end up keeping it.</p>

    <h2 id="offer-people-other-ways-to-do-things">Offer people other ways to do things</h2>
     <p>If you need people to enter details to continue and they can't do this, for example, because they don't have key information to hand, consider whether you could add something to the "No" option to reassure them that there is an alternative.</p>


     <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
      <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
      {{ radios({
        "idPrefix": "example",
        "name": "example",
        "fieldset": {
          "legend": {
            "text": "Do you have your registration details?",
            "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
          }
        },
        "items": [
          {
            "value": "yes",
            "text": "Yes"
          },
          {
            "value": "no",
            "text": "No, try another way"
          }
        ]
      }) }}
    </div>
     <p>The current version of the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/nhs-login/">NHS login</a> does something like this. If users don't have registration details from their GP practice, they can still register by entering some personal details and uploading a photo ID and a short video they make about themselves.</p>
     <p>Or another example: if you need to ask users for their NHS number, consider giving them another way to complete the task without it. For example, by using a combination of other personal details, like their date of birth and postcode.</p>

    <h2>Test your questions and routing decisions</h2>

    <p>It can help to use post-its, or print out and cut up a paper prototype, to see how the answers might take users on 1 journey or another.</p>

    <p>If a lot of people can't answer "Yes" or "No", reconsider your question.</p>
