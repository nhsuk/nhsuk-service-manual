  <h2>Use your discovery phase to understand the service you're designing</h2>
  <p>Make sure your team understands:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your users' needs and their <a href="/accessibility">accessibility</a> challenges</li>
    <li>your different user groups and how your decisions will affect them</li>
    <li>the purpose and context of the form</li>
    <li>how your service collects and stores information from users now</li>
    <li>the wider user journey and the service (and processes) around the form</li>
    <li>any constraints you may face including, for example, legislation, clinical or financial constraints</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It will help if your team also:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>tests any existing forms, paper or digital – <a href="/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/test-your-questions">read more about testing</a></li>
    <li>talks about technology options</li>
    <li>decides how you'll measure success</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Improve your form at any time</h2>
  <p>If you cannot do a proper discovery, you can still improve your form.</p>
  <p>Get the members of your team to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>each choose a hypothetical person (a typical user, based on your user research), give them a name and a background story, including why that person is filling in the form and what they feel about it</li>
    <li>choose just 1 of the hypothetical people that team members have thought of</li>
    <li>fill in the form as that person, as realistically as you can</li>
    <li>talk about the issues you've found in the interface, the content and the service design</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This exercise may help you identify areas to prioritise. Then do your user research and test your assumptions.</p>
