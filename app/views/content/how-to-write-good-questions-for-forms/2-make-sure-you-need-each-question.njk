    <h2 id="understand-why-you're-asking-each-question">Understand why you're asking each question</h2>
    <p>Make a list of all the information you need from your users now for you to deliver the service. Having a list forces you to question why you're asking users for each item of information. It also helps you challenge unnecessary questions. (This list is sometimes called a "question protocol".)</p>
    <p>Work out what <a href="#use-information-your-organisation-already-has">information your organisation already has (or can access)</a> and where you have information gaps. Ask the questions that let you fill the gaps.</p>

    <h2>Only ask for information you definitely need</h2>
    <p>Only include a question when you know these things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>that you need the information to deliver the service</li>
        <li>why you need it</li>
        <li>who in the organisation uses the information and how</li>
        <li>which users need to give you the information</li>
        <li>how you'll check that the information is accurate - and your validation rules</li>
        <li>what you'll do if the user gives you the wrong answer or no answer</li>
        <li>how you'll keep the information up to date and secure</li>
      </ul>
    <p>If you don't know how you'll use an answer, find out or remove the question.</p>
    <p>All the data you capture is subject to data protection legislation, including GDPR.  Get specialist advice on protecting users' confidentiality and privacy. (That's another reason to collect as little as possible.)</p>

    <h2 id="start-with-essential-questions">Start with essential questions and add optional ones later</h2>
    <p>Decide if each question is essential (sometimes called "required" or "mandatory") or not. It is essential if the user can't get the service unless they give you this information.</p>

    <p>People sometimes think personal data is essential. <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/3-consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions">Consider the sensitivities of your questions</a> and the data you really need. For example, do you need to ask someone's gender if they have a broken leg?</p>

    <p>Only add optional questions if your users seem to need them.</p>

    <p>Mark optional fields with "(optional)" - in brackets. Do not mark essential fields with asterisks.</p>
    <h2 id="use-information-your-organisation-already-has">Use information your organisation already has - or can access</h2>
    <p>If you already have some data about the user, you may only need them to confirm that it's correct.</p>
    <p>Investigate whether you can get some of the information you need from another NHS system.</p>

      <div class="nhsuk-details__text">

      <p>The NHS has <a href="https://your-data-matters.service.nhs.uk/">a service that lets patients choose if data from their health records is shared for research and planning</a>. As part of the service, users need to confirm their identity. They can do this by giving their NHS number. But the team found that some users struggled to find their number.</p>
      <p>So they designed a way users could prove their identity by using their personal details instead. This used a patient database API which needed the user's:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>name</li>
        <li>date of birth</li>
        <li>postcode</li>
        <li>gender</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The API needs gender (the service doesn't), but not everyone wants to answer a question about gender. The team gets around this by calling the API 4 times - once for each of the options for gender.</p>
      <p>That way they don't have to ask users their gender and this makes the service more inclusive.</p>

    <h2>Postpone questions you could ask later</h2>
    <p>If you’re asking for answers that you don’t need right now, consider collecting the information afterwards.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>On an application form, first ask the questions that let you and the user know if they're eligible, then come back to questions that determine what they will get.</li>
          <li>For psychological therapies, do not ask your users to take a clinical assessment (like a depression score sheet) as part of their self-referral form - ask them to fill it in later on.</li>
