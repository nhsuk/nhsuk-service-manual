    <h2>Begin prototyping with 1 thing per page</h2>
    <p>Follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#start-with-one-thing-per-page">GOV.UK principle of each page containing just 1 thing</a>, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 piece of information you’re telling a user</li>
      <li>1 decision they have to make</li>
      <li>1 question they have to answer</li>
  </ul>
    <p>User research will tell you when you can merge pages together. For example, if you’re designing a service for staff who need to repeat and switch between tasks quickly.</p>
    <h3>Watch out for "double-barrelled" questions</h3>
    <p>Make sure you're asking 1 question at a time - not 2 questions in 1 (sometimes called "double-barrelled" questions).</p>

        <p>2 questions in 1: “If you have an email address, can we contact you about research?”</p>

        <p>3 questions in 1: "If this questionnaire has highlighted any problems, how difficult have these problems made it for you to do your work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people?"</p>

    <h2>Start with essential, common, and easy questions</h2>
      <p><a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/2-make-sure-you-need-each-question#start-with-essential-questions">Start with essential questions</a> ahead of optional ones.</p>
      <p>Design for the most common scenarios first. You should have a good idea what they are from your discovery.</p>
      <p>It may help to start with easy questions (<a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/6-think-of-the-form-as-a-conversation#consider-the-effort-involved-in-answering">consider the effort involved in answering</a>) and to save more difficult or <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/3-consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions">sensitive questions</a> for later.</p>

      <h2>Get your "filter" questions in early</h2>
      <p><a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/4-use-yes-no-questions-but-be-careful#what-are-filter-questions">"Filter" questions</a> help you route people to the questions that apply to them, so use them early on.</p>
      <p>For example, start with questions that let users know if they’re not eligible for the service, so you don’t waste their time.</p>


      <h2>Group similar topics</h2>
      <p>Talk through the questions and listen for natural pauses, for example, between topics. <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/6-think-of-the-form-as-a-conversation">Think of the form as a conversation</a>.</p>
      <p>You could group questions according to where users will get the answer. Is it something they know well or will they have to seek out the information? For example, group contact details together and account details together.</p>

    <h2>Test the order when you test your questions</h2>
    <p><a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/8-test-your-questions">Test your questions</a> to get a good idea what a sensible order is. Your user research will show which questions users expect first. For example, do they expect to give you personal details at the start or do they want to deal with the task first and give you personal details at the end?</p>
    <p>Do card sorting with users to understand which questions go together.</p>
