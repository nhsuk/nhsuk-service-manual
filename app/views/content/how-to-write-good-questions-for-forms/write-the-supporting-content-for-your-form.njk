  <h2>Name your form</h2>
  <p>If you have not already done so, name your form or service. (See the GOV.UK guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service">Naming your service</a>.)</p>
  <p>Focus on the task, on what the user wants to do.</p>

  <h2>Introduce the form</h2>
  <p>Introduce and explain your form or service to users. This is your chance to stop the wrong people filling in the form and to set expectations.<p>
  <p>You could try a start page, like the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-pages/">GOV.UK start page pattern</a>. (We are developing <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/issues/169">an NHS start page pattern for the service manual in GitHub</a>.) Be aware that users often ignore text under the start button (and any "Continue" buttons).</p>
  <p>Also, user journeys rarely start with the start page and many forms or services do not need a special start page. Think about how users will get to your form or service as well as how to introduce it.</p>

  <h2 id="give-users-help-in-context">Give users help in context</h2>
  <p>If users need help or guidance with filling in a question, do not link to something labelled "help". Put just enough help where they need it - and only if you see in research that they need it.</p>
  <p>For example, users do not usually need to be told to "Select the answer that applies to you" with <a href="/styles-components-patterns/radios">radios</a>, but they may need telling to "Select all options that are relevant to you" with <a href="/styles-components-patterns/checkboxes">checkboxes</a>.</p>

    {{ checkboxes({
      "idPrefix": "contact",
      "name": "contact",
      "fieldset": {
        "legend": {
          "text": "How would you like to be contacted?",
          "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
        }
      },
      "hint": {
        "text": "Select all options that are relevant to you."
      },
      "items": [
        {
          "value": "email",
          "text": "Email"
        },
        {
          "value": "phone",
          "text": "Phone"
        },

  <p>Answer users' questions in context, like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"What's this?"</li>
    <li>"Why do you want this information?"</li>
    <li>"Where can I find this?"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use it to explain:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>any necessary jargon</li>
    <li>where to find their NHS number</li>
    <li>what format users should give information in</li>
    <li>what youâ€™ll do with personal information</li>
    <li>the consequences of making 1 choice over another</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>

  <p>Good help text saves having to write <a href="#error-messages">error messages</a>.</p>
  <p>Bear in mind that users may miss the help text. Sometimes a <a href="/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/use-filter-questions-to-route-users#what-are-filter-questions">filter question</a> will work better.</p>

  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
    <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
    <p>If you have to explain your interface, it needs more work.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>How to add help text</h3>
  <p>We do not recommend tool tips. They can be hard for users to see and are not accessible.<p>
  <p>Instead you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>add hint text as a part of other form inputs, such as <a href="/styles-components-patterns/text-input#using-hint-text">text inputs</a>, <a href="/styles-components-patterns/radios#radios-with-hints">radios</a> and <a href="/styles-components-patterns/checkboxes#checkbox-items-with-hints">checkboxes</a>, for help that's relevant to most of your users</li>
    <li>use the <a href="/styles-components-patterns/details">details component</a> to reveal expanding help text - this is useful if the help text is only relevant for some users</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="error-messages">Use error messages to explain what went wrong</h2>
  <p>Think of error messages as a step in <a href="/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/think-of-the-form-as-a-conversation">the conversation</a>. Tell the user how to fix the problem as soon as you can.</p>
  <p>If you <a href="/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/get-the-questions-into-order#begin-prototyping-with-1-thing-per-page">begin prototyping with 1 thing per page</a>, you can deal with errors for 1 thing at a time.</p>
  <p>Read more about <a href="/styles-components-patterns/error-message">error messages</a> in the service manual.</p>
  <p>Also think about error messages if your service, or a service you use, fails. For example, GOV.UK has patterns for "<a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/service-unavailable-pages/">Service unavailable</a>" and "<a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/problem-with-the-service-pages/">There's is a problem with the service</a>".</p>

  <h2 id="end-with-a-confirmation-or-thank-you-page">End with a confirmation or thank you page</h2>
  <p>Consider how you can reassure users they have completed the form and help them understand what to do next.</p>
  <p>You could try:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a confirmation page, like the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/confirmation-pages/">GOV.UK confirmation page pattern</a> (we are developing <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/issues/144">an NHS confirmation page pattern for the service manual in GitHub)</a></li>
    <li>a <a href="/styles-components-patterns/summary-list">summary list</a> to summarise users' responses and let them check their answers, as in <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/check-answers/">the GOV.UK check answers pattern</a></li>
    <li><a href="/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/think-of-the-form-as-a-conversation#pause-to-allow-users-to-reflect">pausing to allow users to reflect, for example, for a declaration</a> or "signature"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Look at your content across channels</h2>
  <p>Think beyond the form. For the user, it is likely to be a cross-channel experience. Remember to make your on and offline content consistent, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>paper or downloadable forms</li>
    <li>introductory emails or letters</li>
    <li>confirmation emails or text messages</li>
    <li>call centre scripts</li>
    <li>follow up emails or letters</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Read more about writing content for transactions</h2>
  <p>GOV.UK has some good guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/govuk-content-transactions">designing how GOV.UK content and transactions work together</a>.</p>
