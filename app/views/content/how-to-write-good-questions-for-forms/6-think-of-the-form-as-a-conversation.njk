    <h2>Build trust and give users a positive experience of care</h2>

     <p>Do not rush things. Ask for information at the appropriate time. <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/3-consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions">Consider the sensitivities around your questions</a>. Be respectful and inclusive.</p>
    <p>Balance moving users through the task with prompts, reassurance and explanations. (But do not try to reassure people by describing the task as "easy" or "simple".) Offer help: on the web, on phone or in person. Use <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/7-write-the-supporting-content-for-your-form#help-text">help text</a>, <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/7-write-the-supporting-content-for-your-form#error-messages">error messages</a> and guidance in the form. Help people understand their mistakes and make it easy for them to get support.</p>

    <h2>Think about where your user will be when they fill in the form</h2>
    <p>Will they be at home, on their mobile, or using someone else's phone in an emergency, for example? How they will be feeling?</p>
    <p>Will they be filling in the form themselves? If someone may be filling in the form for them, that may change how appropriate the question is.</p>
  <details class="nhsuk-details">
      <summary class="nhsuk-details__summary">
        <span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text">
          Example: a callback number
        </span>
      </summary>
      <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
        <p>If you’re offering a callback service, rather than asking for "your" phone number or "their" phone number, ask "What number do you want us to call you on?"</p>
      </div>
    </details>

     <h2>Use clear language that users understand</h2>

    <p>Use familiar words in familiar ways. Listen to your users to get an idea of the language they use: for example, (high) "blood pressure", not "hypertension". Find out how they describe the information you're asking them for.</p>
    <p>Do not hide behind the passive tense. Not "Your GP will be notified' but "We will let your GP know".</p>

    <h2>Be less formal</h2>
    <p>Ask questions the way you would in person. Soften your language. Instead of "You must confirm this", explain "Before you continue, you need to confirm this". Try reading your questions to a colleague and listening to how they answer them.</p>
    <p>Do not just repeat a message if someone gets things wrong a second time. It can feel harsh. Think about how you could rephrase it.</p>
    <p>Do not ask for the users' "Full name", for example, if you just need their "Name" or "Contact name". (But be clear whose name you're asking for. For example, do not rely on a page title "Next of kin" and then ask for their "Name". Say "Name of next of kin".)</p>

    <h3>But avoid using "Please"</h3>
    <p>"Please" suggests that people have a choice. Sometimes it can feel patronising. It's not usually necessary.</p>

    <h2>Use "I" and "you" appropriately</h2>
    <p>Use "you" or "your" when you're asking questions, giving instructions or describing things. For example: "Have you changed your name?"</p>
    <p>Use "I" or "me" for things that the user will do or say, for example when they click a button or select a checkbox. For example: "Add me". But only use "I" or "me" when you need to.</p>
    <p>Check how this works by talking through your questions with a colleague, one of you playing the computer, the other answering as the user.</p>


    <h2>Make the conversation flow</h2>
    <p>Word questions or statements consistently. This helps users get into a rhythm of answering and lets them focus on the content of the questions rather than how they’re presented.</p>
    <p>It's OK to ask a follow up question. For example: "We think you mean this. Is that right?". You do not need to validate the question on the same page. Sometimes it's more effective to check it on the next page.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pause to allow users to reflect</h2>
    <p>Give users a chance to think twice if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you want them to look carefully at something, like checking a photo they've uploaded</li>
      <li>they're about to do something destructive, like deleting a document</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Declarations at the end of the form are a time to pause. We sometimes use thems to ask users to confirm that they:
    <ul>
      <li>commit to give careful, honest answers</li>
      <li>are happy to hand their application over so that we can take the next step</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Before you include a declaration, find out what your users expect and understand by it.</p>

    <h2>Ask questions that users can answer easily</h2>
    <p>Closed questions are usually easier than open ones. (<a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/4-use-yes-no-questions-but-be-careful">Use Yes No questions, but be careful</a>.) Several short questions are often easier than 1 long one.</p>

    <h3 id="consider-the-effort-involved-in-answering">Consider the effort involved in answering</h3>
    <p>There are increasing levels of difficulty involved, depending on whether users will get the answer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>from their heads</li>
      <li>from information they have to hand</li>
      <li>by figuring something out</li>
      <li>by asking someone else - for example, arranging a witness or referee</li>
    </ul>

    <details class="nhsuk-details">
      <summary class="nhsuk-details__summary">
        <span class="nhsuk-details__summary-text">
        Example of a difficult question
        </span>
      </summary>
      <div class="nhsuk-details__text">

        <p>"What percentage of your working day do you spend doing moderate-intensity activities that make you breathe faster and raise your heart rate (such as brisk walking or housework, like vacuuming) for at least 10 minutes continuously?"</p>

        <p>To answer a question like this, the user has to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>understand and interpret the question</li>
          <li>think and remember - or go and check something</li>
          <li>make a judgement - or estimate (some people find calculations like percentages difficult)</li>
          <li>choose an answer - and hope it matches an option on the form</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here the user has to work out, for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>when their working day starts and ends</li>
          <li>what a typical day is</li>
          <li>whether to tell you about a typical day or a more active one</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </details>

    <h2>Decide whether to use a question or a statement</h2>
    <p>For page titles you can use either a question or a statement.</p>
    <p>If you want people to enter information, action statements work well. Be specific about what you want them to do.</p>
    <p> For example, we say "Enter the details your GP surgery gave you", not "What are your patient registration details?". This makes it clear what we want people to do - to "enter the details".</p>

    <p>Questions work well for <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/radios">radios</a> or <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/checkboxes">checkboxes</a> or for a short question like "What's your name?".</p>
