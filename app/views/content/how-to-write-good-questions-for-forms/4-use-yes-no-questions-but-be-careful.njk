    <h2>What are "filter" questions?</h2>

    <img class="nhsuk-image__img nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7" src="/service-manual/assets/binary-question-long.png" alt="">

    <p>Filter (or branching) questions ask a short question first - often a Yes No question like this, with <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/radios">radios</a>. </p>

    <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
      <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
      {{ radios({
        "idPrefix": "example",
        "name": "example",
        "fieldset": {
          "legend": {
            "text": "Are you 18 or over?",
            "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
          }
        },
        "items": [
          {

            "text": "Yes"
          },
          {
            "value": "no",
            "text": "No"
          }
        ]
      }) }}
    </div>
    <p>Filter questions help you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>get people to the questions that apply to them - so use them early on</li>
      <li>avoid optional questions, because users only answer the questions that apply to them</li>
      <li>simplify long questions by breaking them up</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But often you need more than a simple Yes or No.</p>

  <h2>Spell out what "Yes" and "No" mean</h2>
  <p>Here's a bad example.</p>
  <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
      <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
      {{ radios({
        "idPrefix": "example",
        "name": "example",
        "fieldset": {
          "legend": {
            "text": "Can we email you about research?",
            "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
          }
        },
        "items": [
          {
            "value": "yes",
            "text": "Yes"
          },
          {
            "value": "no",
            "text": "No"
          }
        ]
      }) }}
    </div>

    <p>Be clear, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>"Yes, you can contact me by email about research"</li>
      <li>"No, do not contact me about research"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a simple Yes No question, "No" could also mean:<p>
    <ul>
      <li>"No, do not contact me by email"</li>
      <li>"No, do not contact me at all"</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Offer people other ways to do things</h2>
     <p>If, for example, you need people to enter details to continue with their online journey and they don't have them to hand, consider whether you could add information to the "No" option to reassure them that there is an alternative.</p>
     <p>For example,say: "No, try another way".</p>

    <h2>Beware binary choices</h2>
    <p>There are often more options than you think, including, for example, "I don't know" or "I'm not sure".</p>

    <div class="app-example nhsuk-u-margin-top-7 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-7">
      <strong class="nhsuk-tag nhsuk-tag--dark-grey app-example__heading">Example</strong>
      {{ radios({
        "idPrefix": "example",
        "name": "example",
        "fieldset": {
          "legend": {
            "text": "Do you know your NHS number?",
            "classes": "nhsuk-fieldset__legend--m"
          }
        },
        "items": [
          {
            "value": "yes",
            "text": "Yes, I know my NHS number"
          },
          {
            "value": "no",
            "text": "No, I do not know my NHS number"
          },
          {
            "value": "unsure",
            "text": "I'm not sure"
          }
        ]
      }) }}
    </div>

    <p>Having the 3rd option means that you can give people some extra help with finding their number.</p>

    <p>If you're drafting a Yes No question, it can help to test it by leaving a space for people to type something in something different.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, if people can't answer "Yes" or "No", it may be a sign that you should reconsider your question.</p>

  <h2>Be careful with "Other"</h2>
  <p>Sometimes "Other" is a useful option, but be wary of using it with personal data or <a href="/service-manual/content/how-to-write-good-questions-for-forms/3-consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions">sensitive topics</a>. It can make people feel that you don't care enough about their personal circumstances to be specific.</p>

  <p>Be especially careful with "Other" or "Mixed" ethnicity in the context of health information. Do not use these categories to provide health information.</p>â€‹
