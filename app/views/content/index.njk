  <p>This style guide is for anyone creating content for the NHS, to help make things clear and consistent across all of our services.</p>
  <p>It's meant as a guide, not a rulebook. You're welcome to adapt a style pattern if it does not meet your users' needs.</p>
  <p>Check the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style">GOV.UK A to Z style guide</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk">GOV.UK content design guide</a> for any points of style that you do not find here.</p>
  <p>If it's not there, talk to colleagues on the <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/TDJTLBAJK/CT2UL6RNJ">#content channel on the service manual public Slack</a> or <a href="mailto:service-manual@nhs.net">email the service manual team</a> to see if anyone has any experience of or research insight into the issue.</p>
