<p>This page explains how to write NHS App messages, text messages, emails and letters for patients and the public. It gives practical advice on structure, tone and wording so your message is easy to understand and act upon.</p>

<h2 id="who-this-guidance-is-for">Who this guidance is for</h2>

<p>This guidance is for anyone who writes or edits patient messages, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>content designers</li>
  <li>communications teams</li>
  <li>administration staff</li>
</ul>
{% from "inset-text/macro.njk" import insetText %}

{% set insetTextHtml %}
  <p>If you need guidance on messaging strategy, governance requirements, or using NHS Notify visit the <a href="#">NHS Messaging best practice website</a>.</p>
{% endset %}

{{ insetText({
  html: insetTextHtml
}) }}
<p>Use this guidance if you want to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>write messages that work well on different channels</li>
  <li>choose wording that patients understand and can act upon</li>
  <li>make content inclusive and accessible for a wide range of patients</li>
  <li>find examples and templates to reference when writing your message</li>
</ul>
<p>This guidance was developed with input from clinical safety, governance and delivery teams across NHS England. It brings together established writing standards and findings from user research into how NHS messages are read and understood.</p>
<p>It sits alongside the NHS Messaging best practice website so teams can plan, write and send messages in a joined-up and consistent way.</p>

<h2 id="writing-effective-messages">Writing effective messages</h2>
<p>Always consider the needs of the patient and any clinical safety requirements as well as the channel you are using, when writing your message.</p>
<p>General guidance for writing messages in any channel includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use plain simple English and follow the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/voice-and-tone" title="External website">NHS content guide for voice and tone</a></li>
  <li>keep messages short and concise as they'll be easier for the reader to scan</li>
  <li>put whatever matters most first</li>
  <li>use short, descriptive titles or subject lines</li>
  <li>if you include more than one call to action (not recommended) make it clear which is the priority</li>
  <li>only include links when they are necessary and have a clear purpose</li>
  <li>test your messages with users before sending them</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-write-for-different-channels">Writing for different channels</h2>

<p>If your service has a fallback strategy you may be required to write the same message for multiple channels.</p>
<p>Writing messages specifically for the channel means users are more likely to understand and engage important health-related requests or advice. For example, copying and pasting the contents of a letter into a text message or App message is bad practice as this can create formatting issues and could result in a poor user experience.</p>
<p>Find out how to write for different channels by referring to the specific chanel guidance on this page.</p>
<h2 id="nhs-app-messages">NHS App messages</h2>

<p>The NHS App is a free and secure way to communicate with patients and the public. Consider the following when writing messages for the App.</p>

<h3 id="greeting-app">Greeting</h3>
<p>You may consider a greeting unnecessary for patients receiving their messages in the App. If you start your message with a greeting make sure you use "Dear" followed by the patient's name and not "Hi" or similar.</p>
<p>Choosing which name to use depends on the context of the message. Use a first name when you want to be more encouraging or conversational. For a more formal or reassuring tone consider using a full name.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>conversational tone - "Dear ((firstName))"</li>
  <li>reassuring tone - "Dear ((firstName))((LastName))"</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid using just a last name or first name without a greeting as it can sound impersonal.</p>

<h3 id="protecting-people-from-spam-and-phishing-app">Protecting people from spam and phishing</h3>
<p>To access messages in the App, patients need to go through NHS login. This means App messages are more secure than email messages or text. Research has shown patients are more likely to trust links in the NHS App, and because the App is secure you can use text links rather than having to write out the full URL as in a text message or email.</p>
<p><a href="https://notify.nhs.uk/using-nhs-notify/links-and-urls" title="External website">Find out how to use text links and URLs in an App message when using NHS Notify.</a>.</p>

<h3 id="telling-patients-who-your-message-is-from-app">Telling patients who your message is from</h3>
<p>Patients and the public are more likely to trust a message if they know who sent it. You can choose the sender name that is displayed with your App message when you onboard with NHS Notify.</p>
<p>Your sender name can help recipients quickly identify your service, for example "NHS Vaccination Invitations", "NHS App" or "Tree Tops Medical  Practice". Due to the way sender name is displayed in the App you may consider not using a signature at the end of your message.</p>
<p><a href="https://notify.nhs.uk/using-nhs-notify/tell-recipients-who-your-messages-are-from#nhs-app-sender-name%22%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://notify.nhs.uk/using-nhs-notify/tell-recipients-who-your-messages-are-from#nhs-app-sender-name" title="External website">Read about how NHS Notify uses sender names</a>.</p>

<h3 id="length-of-message-app">Length of message</h3>
<p>NHS App messages can be up to 5,000 characters, but research shows some patients will only read the first part of the message.</p>
<p>Make longer messages easier for your reader to scan by:</p>
<ul>
<li>keeping messages concise</li>
<li>putting the important information first</li>
<li>breaking longer content into short paragraphs or steps</li>
<li>using bullet point lists and section headings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SenderID: </strong>NHS Screening<p>
<p>We’re inviting you to do a test for human papillomavirus (HPV) at home.</p>
<p>HPV is the name of a very common group of viruses. They do not cause any problems in most people, but high-risk types can cause cervical cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Why you’re being invited</strong></p>
<p>Our records show you have been invited for cervical screening, previously known as a ‘smear test’, but have not attended or not attended in a while.</p>
<p>Cervical screening tests for high-risk HPV and can let you know if you’re at risk of developing cervical cancer.</p>
<p>However, for those who haven't had regular cervical screening, we're offering an alternative option called HPV self-testing.</p>
<p><strong>What HPV self-testing is</strong></p>
<p>HPV self-testing checks for high-risk HPV, which causes nearly all cervical cancers.</p>
<p>It's not a test for cancer. It's a test to help prevent cancer.<a href="#" title="External website">Find out more about HPV self-testing</a>.</p>
<p>It's different to the cervical screening test done at your GP surgery or sexual health clinic. You will take a sample from your vagina and won't need to reach your cervix.</p>
<p>You might find this more comfortable than cervical screening at your GP surgery or sexual health clinic. If you need additional support to help you do the test, for example, if you have a physical or learning disability, you can speak to your GP practice.</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Order your free kit online.</li>
<li>Do the test following the instructions in the kit.</li>
<li>Return the kit in the prepaid packaging.</li>
<li>Your results will be sent to you within 14 days.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Getting your results</strong></p>
<p>If your test is negative, you won't need to do anything.</p>
<p>If your test is positive, we'll ask you to go for a cervical screening test at your GP surgery or a sexual health clinic. This is to check for any abnormal changes to the cells in your cervix.</p>
<p><strong>Other ways to get tested</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to take part in HPV self-testing, you can still come for your regular cervical screening, even if you were invited months or years ago. Contact your GP surgery or <a href="#" title="External website">sexual health clinic </a>to make an appointment.</p>

<h2 id="text-messages">Text messages</h2>

<p>Make sure text messages are brief, direct and contain a clear action that patients can follow. Use simple language and avoid unnecessary detail that may make the message too long or unclear.</p>

<h3 id="greeting-text">Greeting</h3>
<p>For brevity and to save characters text messages do not always require a formal greeting. Start your message with the patient’s first or full name as people are more likely to trust a text message if it is personalised.</p>
<p>You can consider a formal greeting if it matches the required tone or content of your message.</p>

<h3 id="protecting-people-from-spam-and-phishing-text">Protecting people from spam and phishing</h3>
<p>Patients are more likely to read and engage with your message if they are confident it is from the NHS. There are ways you can make it easier for them to correctly recognise a genuine NHS message. Consider asking someone to check your messages for errors before you send them.</p>
<p>Avoid:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, inaccuracies or poor formatting</li>
    <li>abbreviations or acronyms the patient may not be familiar with</li>
  </ul>

<p>Where possible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>include the name of your service or organisation</li>
    <li>reference an event they may be familiar with such as an appointment or test</li>
    <li>follow NHS guidance on voice and tone</li>
  </ul>

<p><a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/voice-and-tone" title="External website">Read about voice and tone</a>.</p>

<p>If you include links in your text message make sure they:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>go to trusted sites such as nhs.uk or gov.uk</li>
    <li>are human readable, for example, nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments</li>
    <li>include the full URL and only use approved official shortened links</li>
    <li>do not contain any personal information such as the patient’s name or NHS number</li>
    <li>are consistent across all your messaging channels so people can check them independently</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="formatting-text">Formatting</h3>
<p>Text messages do not support formatting such as bullet points, numbered lists, bold text or headings. However, you can use paragraph breaks to make it more readable. If you are condensing a longer message into a text message, make sure it works without formatting.</p>

<p><a href="https://notify.nhs.uk/using-nhs-notify/formatting" title="External website">Find out more about message formatting when using NHS Notify</a>.</p>

<h3 id="telling-patients-who-your-message-is-from-text">Telling patients who your message is from</h3>
<p>The text message sender name (also called SenderID) shows the reader who the text message is from and is often the first thing they see when reading a text or App notification. If you choose a recognisable SenderID, they can quickly tell who the message is from and are more likely to open and read it.</p>

<p><a href="https://notify.nhs.uk/using-nhs-notify/tell-recipients-who-your-messages-are-from#text-message-sender-name" title="External website">Read more about text sender message names when using NHS Notify</a>.</p>

<h3 id="length-of-message-text">Length of message</h3>

<p>If a text message is longer than 160 characters including spaces, it will be charged as more than one message. Some signs and symbols count as two characters. Using accented characters may also increase the cost of your text message.</p>

<h2 id="emails">Emails</h2>
<p>Emails are a cost-effective channel for longer messages, but keep them brief and direct and include a clear action that patients can follow.</p>
<p>When sending an email:</p>
<ul>
  <li>keep subject lines short and descriptive</li>
  <li>avoid attachments</li>
  <li>send from official NHS domains such as @nhs.net or @nhs.uk</li>
  <li>use formatting such as headings and lists if it makes the message easier to read</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="greeting-email">Greeting</h3>
<p>Patients are more likely to engage with a message that’s relevant and clearly meant for them. If you start your message with a greeting you should use "Dear" and not "Hi" or similar.</p>

<h3 id="protecting-people-from-spam-and-phishing-email">Protecting people from spam and phishing</h3>
<p>Patients do not trust messages with poor formatting, spelling mistakes, grammatical errors or inaccuracies. Write messages that follow <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/content/voice-and-tone" title="External website">NHS voice and tone guidance.</a> Consider asking someone to check your messages for errors before you send them.</p>

<p>Further ways to protect people from spam or phishing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>avoid making requests for personal information, like a patient's date of birth, in the content of your messages</li>
  <li>only include recognisable links to trusted websites such as the NHS website (www.nhs.uk) or the GOV.UK website</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="telling-patients-who-your-message-is-from-email">Telling patients who your message is from</h3>
<p>When sending an email, there are several ways to tell the patient who it is from. Use an email sender name that clearly represents your NHS organisation or service. You should also use this name at the end of the email.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
{% from "inset-text/macro.njk" import insetText %}
{% set insetTextHtml %}
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>NHS vaccination invitations</p>
{% endset %}

{{ insetText({
  html: insetTextHtml

<p>For the email subject line use something specific like "Your GP appointment reminder" or "NHS vaccination invitation" rather than a generic "NHS invite". Keeping subject lines short will make your email stand out in a patient’s inbox and is more likely to be opened and read.</p>

<h2 id="paper-letters">Paper letters</h2>

<p>Letters allow for longer messages and you can format the text to include headings and bullet points. They are available in large print and braille, which makes them more accessible for some patients. There may also be legal or clinical safety reasons for using letters.</p>
<p>Letters are expensive to send and a digital alternative should always be considered.</p>

<h3 id="greeting-letters">Greeting</h3>

<p>Letters tend to be more formal so start your message with " Dear" and not "Hi " or similar. Including a greeting is important as it builds trust.</p>

<h3 id="telling-patients-who-your-message-is-from-letter">Telling patients who your letter is from</h3>

<p>Consider displaying your service name in a header as well as in the signature, so patients can quickly recognise who the letter is from. For consistency this should match the name used in your NHS App messages, emails or text messages.</p>

<h3 id="formatting-and-templates-letters">Formatting and templates</h3>

<p>You can format your letter to include bullet points, numbered lists, bold text, headings and more.</p>

<p>Dear ((firstName))((lastName)),</p>
<p>Measles cases are increasing in England, so it’s important you are fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>We’re inviting you to book a free measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination. This is because your NHS record suggests you have not completed your two-dose course of the MMR vaccine. You need two doses for the best protection against measles, mumps and rubella.</p>
<p>These illnesses spread easily between unvaccinated people. Infection can lead to serious problems including meningitis, hearing loss and problems during pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>How to book a vaccination</strong></p>
<p>Please contact your GP surgery to confirm your record and book a vaccination appointment if needed. You can also ask about any other routine NHS vaccinations you may need. They may be able to arrange these for the same appointment. If you have already booked, please attend your appointment.  </p>
<p><strong>More information</strong></p>
<p>The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to protect you against measles, mumps and rubella. Millions of doses are given every year. Most side effects are mild and do not last long. Visit <a href="#" title="External website"> www.nhs.uk/mmr</a> for more information on the vaccine.</p>
<p><p>Visit <a href="#" title="External website"> www.england.nhs.uk/mmr-invites</a> to get this information in easy read and other languages and formats.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, </p>
<p>NHS England Vaccination Team</p>
