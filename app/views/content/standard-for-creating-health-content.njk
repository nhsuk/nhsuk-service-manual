    <h2>Developing this standard</h2>
    <p>This standard, which we've developed with NHS England, replaces their former assessment and certification scheme known as the Information Standard, which has now closed. </p>
    <p>We've carried out user research with a range of NHS organisations and other organisations that create health content. We also consulted the <a href="https://pifonline.org.uk/">Patient Information Forum</a>, a UK organisation that represents health information producers.</p>
    <p>We believe information that is clear, accurate, evidence-based, up to date and easy to use allows people, patients and communities to become better informed and more involved in their health and care.</p>
