    <h2>Developing this standard</h2>
    <p>This standard replaces <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/tis/">NHS England's Information Standard</a>.</p>
    <p>We've carried out user research with a range of NHS organisations and other organisations that create health content. We also consulted the <a href="https://pifonline.org.uk/">Patient Information Forum</a>, a UK organisation that represents health information producers.</p>
