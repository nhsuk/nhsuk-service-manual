<h2>1. Design a clear process for creating content and follow it</h2>
<h3>Essential</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Follow a process for checking content and getting approval, including clinical approval.</li>
  <li>Have a planned review cycle for all content so you keep it up to date and clinically accurate.</li>
  <li>Make clear which organisation has published the content.</li>
  <li>Be transparent about adverts and any potential conflicts of interest, such as sponsorship.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best practice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Follow a clear, consistent, documented process, including version control and archiving.</li>
  <li>Display the date the content was last checked and when it will be checked again.</li>
  <li>Provide training and support so your team can follow the process.</li>
  <li>Use the NHS identity guidelines and design system or follow your organisation's brand and style guidelines.</li>
  <li>Set objectives and identify outcomes for your content and evaluate against them.</li>
  <li>Invite feedback from users (the people who will use your content) so you can review or improve it.</li>
  <li>Actively manage feedback and respond where appropriate.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>2. Use relevant, up to date and recognised clinical evidence</h2>
<h3>Essential</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Create content using high quality clinical evidence.</li>
  <li>Get clinical and other relevant subject matter experts to review and approve content (as part of your process).</li>
  <li>Check the evidence every time you review or update clinical content.</li>
  <li>If you're translating into another language make sure the translation remains clinically accurate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best practice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Keep a record of sources of evidence you use.</li>
  <li>Stay in touch with developments in clinical evidence and update content when evidence changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Comply with relevant laws and regulation</h2>
<h3>Essential</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Follow copyright and licensing rules.</li>
  <li>If relevant, put in place and follow policies for consent, data protection, confidentiality and safeguarding. </li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Focus on user needs</h2>
<h3>Essential</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Develop content based on user and organisation needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best practice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Consult with the people who are going to use your content.</li>
  <li>Design and test your content to make sure it meets their needs.</li>
  <li>Improve your content based on user feedback.</li>
  <li>Involve colleagues and other key stakeholders in developing the content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Make your content easy to use</h2>
<h3>Essential</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure your content and design are simple and clear.</li>
  <li>Use concise, plain English so your content is easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best practice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Choose the most appropriate format for your users and the nature of your content, such as text, images or videos.</li>
  <li>Make sure users can find your content, on the internet and on your website.</li>
  <li>Make it easy for people to navigate to any other content they need, on your site or elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Make your content inclusive and accessible</h2>
<h3>Essential</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Consider how your content affects people with "protected characteristics" (Equality Act 2010).</li>
  <li>Consider people who may have difficulty getting the healthcare they need, like Gypsies and Travellers or people who do not have English as a first language.</li>
  <li>Think about groups who may be under-represented in making decisions about content, such as ethnic minorities or people with disabilities.</li>
  <li>Make your content accessible to everyone who needs it (WCAG 2.2 AA for websites and mobile apps).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best practice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make health information easy to use for people who struggle to read and understand words and numbers.</li>
  <li>Co-design or co-produce content with your users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Developing this standard</h2>
<p>This standard, which we've developed with NHS England, replaces their former assessment and certification scheme known as the Information Standard, which has now closed. </p>
<p>We've carried out user research with a range of NHS organisations and other organisations that create health content. We also consulted the <a href="https://pifonline.org.uk/">Patient Information Forum</a>, a UK organisation that represents health information producers.</p>
<p>We believe information that is clear, accurate, evidence-based, up to date and easy to use allows people, patients and communities to become better informed and more involved in their health and care.</p>
