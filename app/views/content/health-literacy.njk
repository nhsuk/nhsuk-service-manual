  <h2>What is health literacy?</h2>
  <p>Health literacy is about a person's ability to understand and use information to make decisions about their health.</p>
  <p>A user with low health literacy will generally struggle to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>read and understand health information</li>
    <li>know how to act on this information</li>
    <li>know which health services to use and when to use them</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Research shows that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>more than 4 in 10 adults struggle with health content for the public</li>
    <li>more than 6 in 10 adults struggle with health content that includes numbers and statistics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is because a lot of health content is written, often unintentionally, for people with higher health literacy skills.</p>

  <h2>Why health literacy is important</h2>
  <p>Low health literacy has been linked to a range of important problems.</p>
  <p>These include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>unhealthy lifestyles and poor general health</li>
    <li>low use of preventative services, like vaccinations and screening</li>
    <li>difficulty taking medicines correctly</li>
    <li>increased A&amp;E attendances and hospital admissions</li>
    <li>reduced life expectancy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It's estimated that health literacy-related problems like these account for up to 5% of national health spending.</p>
  <p>Health literacy is also a health inequality issue. There is a close link between socio-economic deprivation and low health literacy.</p>

  <h2>Examples of problems caused by low health literacy</h2>
  <p>Here are some real examples where low health literacy caused an issue:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a woman who sprayed her inhaler on her neck because she had been told to spray it on her "throat"</li>
    <li>a man who did not turn up for cancer tests because he did not know Radiology and X-ray department were the same thing</li>
    <li>a man with diabetes who decided to stop taking his medicine because he had trouble understanding the instructions</li>
    <li>a woman who thought chemotherapy would not help because it was given into a vein on the other side of the body to where her cancer was</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It's easy to see from this how miscommunication of health information could be very serious, and how clearer information could help.</p>

  <h2>How you can create better content</h2>
  <p>You can help reduce the problems caused by low health literacy by making sure your content is written at a level most users can understand.</p>
  <p>You can do this by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>following the <a href="/design-system/design-principles">NHS design principles</a> when you create content</li>
    <li>following our advice <a href="/content/how-we-write">how to write for NHS digital services</a></li>
    <li>doing user research with users who have low health literacy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We've found that doing these things benefits all users, not just those with low health literacy.</p>
  <h3>Readability tools</h3>
  <p>We do not recommend readability tools, except to help you prioritise your content. Tools cannot tell you how usable your content is. It's best to test it with your users.</p>
  <p>If you want a tool to help you write clearer, more usable content, you could try the <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway Editor</a>. It will show you where you have long sentences, complicated words, adverbs or the passive voice.</p>
