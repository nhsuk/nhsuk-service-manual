        <h2>Accurate</h2>
            <p>Qualified clinicians check our clinical information and check that it is accurate, clinically safe and has been developed using relevant evidence-based guidance.</p>
            <p>Our content is factual, neutral and unambiguous. We do not use metaphors - we say what we mean.</p>
            <p>We avoid making subjective statements. Use words like "good", "bad", or "easy" with care. For example, don’t talk about "a good chance of recovery".</p>
            <p>We do use "good" and "bad" where our users do to describe their symptoms, for example "bad pain" or "bad breath".</p>
            <p>We also use them when there’s a good evidence base. For example, we talk about "a good source of iron" or "lack of sleep is bad for your health".</p>

          <h2>Clear</h2>
            <p>We use language that our users understand. We use plain English and do research to find out which words work best for them.</p>
            <p>We aim for a reading age of 9 to 11 years old. But we recognise that, with some medical information, it's not easy to achieve this. In this case, try to make sure that an 11 to 14-year old will understand.</p>
            <p>We avoid medical jargon and technical terms. We do use medical terms to help with understanding and search, but explain them when they're not commonly known.</p>
            <p>We use a plain English term first, then the medical term. Example: piles (haemorrhoids).</p>
            <p>We use the same style for specialist audiences like health professionals.</p>

          <h2>Concise</h2>
            <p>We keep content to the point.</p>
            <p>We use short sentences - up to 20 words. We use short paragraphs - up to 3 sentences.</p>
            <p>We use subheadings and bulleted lists to help users find what they need.</p>
            <p>We use the active voice - "find a pharmacy" rather than "a pharmacy can be found".</p>
