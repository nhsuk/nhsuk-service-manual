<p>Inclusion is about valuing people's differences so that everyone feels they belong and can access the services they need, regardless of their background, identity or circumstances.</p>
<p>Some of our users face problems when they use NHS services, for example, because of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>their socio-economic status or living in poverty</li>
  <li>"protected characteristics" like ethnicity, gender reassignment, sexual orientation or disability (see the <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/equality-act/protected-characteristics">protected characteristics on the Equalities and Human Rights Commission website</a>)</li>
  <li>being part of a vulnerable group, such as Travellers, rough sleepers or sex workers</li>
  <li>where they live</li>
</ul>

         Consider co-designing your content
        </h2>
        <p>Involve your users or charities that represent them. You may be able to draw on internal staff networks.</p>
        <p>When you co-design, you share power more equally. Share power at every stage of your project: in research, decision-making, design, delivery and evaluation. Make it an ongoing conversation.</p>
          <div class="app-example app-example--content">
          <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
          <p>The NHS website team designed a new video player, so that it could show British Sign Language (BSL) versions of videos. They worked with an internal Deaf and hard of hearing group and with charities and they iterated prototypes with them.</p>

         Do not make assumptions about your users
        </h2>
        <p>Be aware of your own biases and privilege, so that your design doesnâ€™t just reflect your own lived experiences.</p>
        <p>Carry out user research to make sure your design assumptions are correct.</p>
          <div class="app-example app-example--content">
          <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
          <p>Some NHS website pregnancy content assumed that people were happy about their pregnancy. But a pregnant 15-year-old may not have the same needs as someone who's older with a planned pregnancy. So content designers reviewed the needs of people with different feelings.</p>

         Write for and about people in a way that is inclusive and respectful
        </h2>
        <p>Create your content for a variety of user groups, for example, people with a range of skin tones. Find out about making content about <a href="/content/inclusive-content/skin-symptoms">skin symptoms</a> inclusive.</p>
        <p>Check with the people you're creating content for how they want to be described. Use this inclusive content guide to avoid "othering" or alienating people by mistake. Talk directly to your user.</p>
          <div class="app-example app-example--content">
          <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
          <p>Some old NHS website content stopped addressing the reader as "you" when talking about people with HIV and AIDs, so the content team rewrote it.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

         Ask yourself who could be excluded by your content
        </h2>
        <p>Some groups of people, particularly minority groups, are more likely to be excluded than others. This can be because of their age, abilities, ethnicity, a lack of resources or other circumstances.</p>
          <div class="app-example app-example--content">
          <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
          <p>If someone who is pregnant does not identify as a woman, they may feel excluded by breastfeeding content. One NHS website team interviewed trans men who had given birth  and are creating new content on chestfeeding for this audience.</p>
        </div>

         Consider how to communicate risk in a supportive way
        </h2>
        <p>Understand how your audience feels about a topic. Consider how your content on risks and benefits could cause harm.</p>
        <p>Align your language with how your audience communicates.</p>
          <div class="app-example app-example--content">
          <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
          <p>Parents of children with Down's syndrome criticised the content on the NHS website for its long list of problems. Content designers worked with them and the Down's Syndrome Association to make it more supportive. The NHS website now explains in a balanced way what it's like to have Down's syndrome, using the word "chance" rather than "risk".</p>

         Make sure your images are inclusive and represent your audience
        </h2>
        <p>Try to include a variety of skin tones, genders, ages and body shapes. Consider the importance of the diverse images you are including and what they signify. Challenge stereotypes.</p>
        <p>Add clear, inclusive <a href="/accessibility/content#use-alternative-text-for-images-in-content">alternative text</a> (alt-text) to images for people who use screen readers or other assistive technology.</p>
          <div class="app-example app-example--content">
          <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
          <p>People with black or brown skin may feel excluded if a page has multiple images of people who have white skin and no images of people like themselves.</p>

         Make your content easy for everyone to understand
        </h2>
        <p>Be aware that some people with autism or other cognitive differences understand content differently. People who do not know English as a first language may also struggle with idiom.</p>
        <p>Read the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/#summary">W3C summary on making content usable for people with cognitive and learning disabilities</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/#objective-3-use-clear-and-understandable-content-0">W3C section on clear and understandable content</a>.</p>
          <div class="app-example app-example--content">
          <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
          <p>Some people may interpret "keep an eye on the rash" literally and think they should put their eye on the rash. The NHS website team reworded some content about a rash to make it clearer.</p>

         Make your content accessible to all
        </h2>
        <p>Use our <a href="/accessibility#content">accessibility guidance</a> to make sure your content meets WCAG2.1 AA. Improve it with user research and insight. If possible, get your content reviewed by an independent accessibility auditor.</p>
          <div class="app-example app-example--content">
          <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
          <p>The NHS Digital website is converting PDFs and Word documents that are still being used into accessible web formats. Avoid <a href="/content/pdfs-and-other-non-html-documents">PDFs and other non-HTML documents</a>.</p>

         Test your content with a broad range of users who have diverse backgrounds and abilities
        </h2>
        <p>Be aware of users' challenges and assistive technology they may be using.</p>
        <p>Make sure the way you recruit participants is as inclusive as possible. Test with a diverse pool of people from all backgrounds and lived experiences.</p>
          <div class="app-example app-example--content">
          <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
          <p>The NHS website team tested the chickenpox page with people who have a range of skin tones. They also tested it with people with different access needs including users with a visual impairment, dyslexia, cerebral palsy and a neurological disorder.</p>

         Consider whether you can support individuals' needs
        </h2>
        <p>In your planning, consider translations and accessible formats. (Read about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inclusive-communication/accessible-communication-formats">accessible communication formats on GOV.UK</a>.)</p>
        <p>If you're creating a channel or form, prepare to deal with things people tell you, such as sensitive information or safeguarding concerns.</p>
        <p>If you run a transactional or personalised service (for example to book appointments), check <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/accessibleinfo/">NHS England's Accessible Information Standard</a>. Consider how your content can help your service identify, record and meet the needs of individuals with disabilities, impairments or sensory loss.</p>
          <div class="app-example app-example--content">
          <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
