    <h2>Disabilities and conditions</h2>
    <p>We use positive language and don't label people when talking about disabilities and conditions.</p>
    <p>We do say things like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>people living with a disability, or disabled person</li>
      <li>people with diabetes</li>
      <li>wheelchair user</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not say:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>afflicted by</li>
      <li>suffering from</li>
      <li>victim of</li>
      <li>confined to a wheelchair</li>
      <li>handicapped</li>
      <li>diabetic person</li>
      <li>sick or diseased person</li>
    </ul>
    <p>NHS digital services should be accessible to everyone who needs them. Read more about <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/content">writing for accessibility</a> in the digital service manual.</p>
    <h2>Mental health</h2>
    <p>We do not describe people as mentally ill.</p>
    <p>We do say:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>mental health condition</li>
      <li>mental health problems</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Race, ethnicity, religion and nationality</h2>
    <p>We only refer to people's heritage or religion if it's relevant to the content.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    {{ insetText({
      "HTML": "<p>You're more at risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you are over 40 - or 25 for south Asian people.</p>"
    }) }}
    <h2>Sex, gender and sexuality</h2>
    <p>We make content gender neutral wherever possible.</p>
    <p>Only mention sex, gender or sexuality if relevant. Avoid gender markers, such as Mr, Miss, Mrs, Ms.</p>
    <h3>Gender neutral language</h3>
    <p>We do not label people with their gender identity or sexuality. Instead we say:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>trans woman or trans man</li>
      <li>trans and non-binary people</li>
      <li>lesbian woman</li>
      <li>gay man</li>
      <li>men who have sex with men</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's alright to use "they" to avoid "he or she" or where you need a gender-neutral pronoun.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    {{ insetText({
      "HTML": "<p>You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of osteoarthritis so they can confirm the diagnosis and prescribe any necessary treatment.</p>"
    }) }}
    <h2>Age</h2>
    <p>We do not say old age pensioner, pensioner or OAP.</p>
    <p>We use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>fertilised egg: from conception to 14 days</li>
      <li>embryo: from 2 to 9 weeks</li>
      <li>unborn baby: from week 10 to birth</li>
      <li>baby: 0 to 12 months</li>
      <li>infant: under 2 years</li>
      <li>toddler: 1 to 3 years</li>
      <li>child: 1 to 12 years</li>
      <li>teenager, or young person: 13 to 19 years (we do not say pubescent or adolescent)</li>
      <li>older person: 60 to 70 years</li>
      <li>elderly person: over 70 years</li>
    </ul>
