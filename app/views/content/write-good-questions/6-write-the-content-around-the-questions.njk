<p>It’s not just about the questions. Consider the context of the form, and write help text, hints and error messages too. Brief clear instructions.</p>
<h2>Before the form</h2>
<p>Introduce and explain it: who is it for and when should they fill it in? Say what the form does in the users’ words. See the GDS guidance on naming services.
Who’s eligible and how do you stop the wrong people filling in the form?
Before the form
Set expectations. For example, give them some idea what they will need in order to fill it in. Do they need any form of identity, for example their NHS number?

(Bear in mind though that people often ignore text on start pages [link].)



</p>

<p>Follow the GDS pattern for start pages, but be aware that people often don’t read them. (Refer forward to ‘sense of control’)</p>


<h2>During the form</h2>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Users avoid looking at instructions (and start pages) and focus on the questions. Instead of initial instructions, use brief help text where users need it.
If you’re having to explain your interface, it needs more work.

Do you need fuller guidance? Users don’t generally read it. Try help text first. If you find that you do need it, consider:
layered guidance
paper guidance with online forms and online guidance with paper forms
Help text - and hint text
Put just enough help where the user needs it. For example, answer users’ questions about:
“what’s this?”
“why do you want this information?
“where can I find this?”

GOV.UK has some good advice on adding help text where necessary</p>

<h3>Error messages</h3>
<p>You may need to write more than 1 error message for each field, so they’re as specific to the problem as possible. Focus on telling the user how to fix the problem rather than describing what’s gone wrong. There’s useful GDS guidance on writing good error messages.</p>

<h2>After the form</h2>
<p>Check your answers pages - there’s more information about these and why they work in the section on Giving users a sense of control.</p>
<h3>Thank you pages</h3>
<p>Information about what will happen next. When will the user hear back? How should they get in touch?
Confirmation emails or SMS
Signposting to other help if there’s likely to be a wait, for example to support services

For page titles you can use either a question or a statement. For example, ‘What is your date of birth?’ or just ‘Date of birth’.
After the form
Make it clear:
that the user has completed the form successfully - see the GDS confirmation page
how users can get in touch
how they can change their form or information
when they will get an answer if they don’t get one straightaway
how they can find out more about how you store and manage their information

What if users want to print out or download form, or come back to it and change it later?
