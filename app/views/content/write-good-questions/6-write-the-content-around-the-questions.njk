  <p>GOV.UK has some good guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/govuk-content-transactions">designing how GOV.UK content and transactions work together</a>.</p>
<h2>Before the form</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you haven't already done so, you might want to name your form. (See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service">GOV.UK guidance on naming services</a>.)</li>
  <li>Introduce and explain the form. Who is it for and when should they fill it in? Say what the form does in the users’ words. How will you stop the wrong people filling in the form?  </li>
  <li>Set expectations. For example, give users some idea what they will need in order to fill it in. Do they need any form of identity, such as their NHS number?</li>
  <li>Follow the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-pages/">GOV.UK pattern for start pages</a>, but be aware that people often ignore text on start pages.</li>
</ul>


<h2>During the form</h2>
<h3>Help text</h3>
<p>Users generally avoid looking at instructions and focus on the questions. Rather than giving them instructions at the start, use brief help text where users need it. (And remember, if you’re having to explain your interface, it probably needs more work.)</p>
Sometimes it’s useful to provide help text to explain things like:

legal jargon
where to find obscure information
what format the information should be given in
what you’ll do with a user’s personal information
the consequences of making one choice over another
Only do this if you see in research that your users need it.

How to add help text
You can do this by:

adding hint text inline, immediately next to the part of the page it relates to
using the ‘details’ component to reveal expanding help text - this is useful if the text is only relevant to a subset of users
See examples of hint text and the details component in the GOV.UK Design System.

You might occasionally need to add more detailed text to help users make particularly complex or difficult decisions.

But bear in mind they’re unlikely to read anything longer than 3 lines, so try to keep any text brief and action-focused.
<h3>Longer guidance</h3>
<p>Try help text before you consider writing fuller guidance. Users don’t generally read it.</p> Try help text first. If you find that you do need it, consider:
layered guidance
paper guidance with online forms and online guidance with paper forms
Help text - and hint text
Put just enough help where the user needs it. For example, answer users’ questions about:
“what’s this?”
“why do you want this information?
“where can I find this?”

Use hint for help that’s relevant to the majority of users, like how their information will be used, or where to find it.</p>

<h3>Error messages</h3>
<p>You may need to write more than 1 error message for each field, so they’re as specific to the problem as possible. Focus on telling the user how to fix the problem rather than describing what’s gone wrong. There’s useful GDS guidance on writing good error messages.</p>

<h2>After the form</h2>
<p>Check your answers pages - there’s more information about these and why they work in the section on Giving users a sense of control.</p>
<h3>Thank you pages</h3>
<p>Information about what will happen next. When will the user hear back? How should they get in touch?
Confirmation emails or SMS
Signposting to other help if there’s likely to be a wait, for example to support services

For page titles you can use either a question or a statement. For example, ‘What is your date of birth?’ or just ‘Date of birth’.
After the form
Make it clear:
that the user has completed the form successfully - see the GDS confirmation page https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/confirmation-pages/
how users can get in touch
how they can change their form or information
when they will get an answer if they don’t get one straightaway
how they can find out more about how you store and manage their information

What if users want to print out or download form, or come back to it and change it later?
