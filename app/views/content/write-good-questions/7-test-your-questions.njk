<h2>Test existing forms</h2>
<p>If you have any existing forms, you should have tested them already. If you haven't done so, do it early on.</p>
<p>Try to understand:</p>
<ul>
  <li>if people have the skills they need - the literacy or digital skills, for example. See how long it takes someone with poor basic skills to fill in your form.</li>
  <li>where they misinterpret a question, for example, where they put in the wrong information or not enough information</li>
  <li>where they get frustrated</li>
  <li>where they drop out and why</li>
  <li>if people need to have documents or key information (like their NHS number) to hand when they fill in the form - and how they find them</li>
  <li>if they expect to paste in information, for example, something they prepared earlier - for example, on a complaint form</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a simple prototype to test your new questions</h2>
<p>You may be able to test on paper at this stage. Or build a simple prototype and let users interact with it. Give yourself a chance to change your questions before you start to build the form.</p>

<p>You can also use a script and ask people the questions. That allows you to respond and probe where appropriate to test your questions.</p>

<p>Look for the same things as you did with your existing forms. Focus particularly at this stage on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the words and questions - watch users try to answer them and listen to how they talk about them</li>
  <li>the structure and flow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Test the answers</h2>
<p>Test whether the answers theyâ€™re giving will actually make sense in the overall design of the service.</p>
<p>Talk to the people who:</p>
<ul>
  <li>deal with the forms as they arrive - for example, postroom or reception staff</li>
  <li>use the information in the forms</li>
  <li>deal with enquiries about the forms</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch out for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>any mistakes on the form, especially anything which might fail validation</li>
  <li>if anything mandatory is missing</li>
  <li>if there are internal contradictions, for example where someone has completed 2 items but only 1 is allowed</li>
  <li>if there are any marginal notes, additional information, or accompanying letters to explain entries on the form</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of all, focus on the errors.</p>
