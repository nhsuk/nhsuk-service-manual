<h2>Keep, cut, postpone, explain</h2>
  <h3>Keep</h3>
  <p>If you’re asking for answers that your users are eager to give you, keep those questions.</p>
  <h3>Cut</h3>
  <p>If you’re asking for answers that you don’t need right now or you don’t know how you will use the information, cut the question.</p>
  <p>These sections on this page will help you do this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#know-why-youre-asking-each-question">Know why you're asking each question</a></li>
    <li><a href="#decide-if-its-optional-or-not">Decide if it's optional or not</a></li>
    <li><a href="#use-information-your-organisation-already-has">Use information your organisation already has</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Postpone</h3>
  <p>If you could ask it later, postpone your question.</p>
  <p>This section will help you do this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#consider-collecting-some-information-afterwards">Consider collecting some information afterwards</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Explain</h3>
  <p>If it’s a difficult question that your users don’t want to answer (for example, you’re asking for personal data) or it’s something that needs research or extra thought, explain why you need to ask and how it will help you help them. (And if there’s no benefit to the user, do you really need to ask it?)<p>
  <p>This section will help with this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions">Consider the sensitivities around your questions</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="know-why-youre-asking-each-question">Know why you're asking each question</h2>
<p>Do not include any question if you do not know:</p>
<ul>
  <li>why you're asking it</li>
  <li>how your organisation will use the answer</li>
</ul>
<p>If you didn't check out each question during your discovery phase, now's the time to do it. GOV.UK has some good <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/form-structure#know-why-youre-asking-every-question">guidance to help you know why you’re asking every question</a>.</p>
<h2 id="decide-if-its-optional-or-not">Decide if it's optional or not</h2>
<p>There are 4 kinds of questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>essential ("required") questions - the user can't get the service unless they give you this information</li>
  <li>not essential, but helpful - for example, on a feedback form, the user may give you their contact details if they want a reply</li>
  <li>not essential or helpful to the organisation, but important to the user - for example, they may want to tell you their story</li>
  <li>filter or branching questions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Filter or branching questions let you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>simplify long questions by asking a short Yes or No question first</li>
      <li>steer the user to questions that are relevant to them</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Your organisation may not collect answers to filter questions.</p>
  <p>Read more: <a href="/service-manual/content/write-good-questions/5-be-careful-with-yes-no-questions">Be careful with Yes or No questions</a>.</p>
  <h3>Mark them optional</h3>
  <p>If you ask for optional information, mark the labels of optional fields with "(optional)". Do not mark mandatory fields with asterisks.</p>

  <h2 id="use-information-your-organisation-already-has">Use information your organisation already has</h2>
  <p>[Question about BSA triangulating data to check someone’s NHS no?]</p>

  <h2 id="consider-collecting-some-information-afterwards">Consider collecting some information afterwards</h2>
  <p>Ask for the minimum information your service needs to make a decision and ask for other information afterwards.</p>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>if the person has a broken leg, you don’t need to ask for biological sex yet</li>
    <li>on an application form, first ask the questions that let you and the user know if they're eligible, then come back to questions that determine what they will get</li>
    <li>for psychological therapies, do not ask your users to take a clinical assessment (like a depression score sheet) as part of their self-referral form - ask them to fill it in later on</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="consider-the-sensitivities-around-your-questions">Consider the sensitivities around your questions</h2>
<p>Users may be reluctant to answer questions that ask for sensitive information or for information that seems inappropriate. They will happily give you their postcode to find a local pha rmacy but they may be reluctant to give you their name and date of birth if it's not relevant to what they're doing. If you <a href="#know-why-youre-asking-each-question">know why you're asking each question</a> and how you will use the answer, you can explain it to the user. For example, it helps users to know that you're asking what might seem like strange questions, but these help you know if their case is urgent.</p>
<p>If your service is collecting some information only for statistics and will anonymise it, say so. </p>

<p>Topics that are especially sensitive are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sex assigned at birth or biological sex</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>sexual orientation</li>
  <li>whether or not the person has children or intends to have children</li>
  <li>whether or not they are married, in a partnership, or living with someone</li>
  <li>whether or not they have mental health problems</li>
</ul>


<p>Some people are reluctant to divulge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>their true age - they may have lied about their age before</li>
  <li>their email address - they may be afraid of spam</li>
  <li>their telephone or mobile number - they may be afraid it’ll be used inappropriately</li>
</ul>
<p>There is more guidance on asking users for different kinds of information in the GOV.UK design system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/addresses/">addresses</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/">dates</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/email-addresses/">email addresses</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/ethnic-group/">ethnic groups</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/gender-or-sex/">gender or sex</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/names/">names</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/national-insurance-numbers/">National Insurance numbers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/passwords/">passwords</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/payment-card-details/">payment card details</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/telephone-numbers/">telephone numbers</a></li>
</ul>

  <p>Remember, if you do not know how your service will use the answer, do not ask the question.</p>
