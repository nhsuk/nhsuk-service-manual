  <h2>Use brief, clear language that users understand</h2>
  <ul>
       <li>Use users' words. Listen to them to get an idea of the words they use: for example, (high) "blood pressure", not "hypertension" .</li>
    <li>Do not hide behind the passive tense. Not “Your GP will be notified” but “We will let your GP know.”</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Follow the service manual <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/content">content style guide</a> and the <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/accessibility/content">guidance on accessibility and content</a>.<p>


  <h2>Make it a conversation</h2>
  <p>Make it easy for users to answer the questions, 1 at a time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Think about how the questions flow and whether they're grouped in a way that makes sense to the user. See section 4 to <a href="/service-manual/content/write-good-questions/4-get-the-questions-into-order">get the questions into order</a>.</li>
    <li>Use questions or statements consistently to help users get into a rhythm of answering. This lets them focus on the content of the questions rather than how they’re presented.</li>
    <li>Closed questions are usually easier than open ones (but <a href="/service-manual/content/write-good-questions/5-be-careful-with-yes-no-questions">be careful with Yes and No questions</a>).</li>
    <li>Several short questions are easier than 1 long one.</li>
    <li>It's OK to ask a follow up question. For example: “We think you mean this. Is that right?”</li>
    <li>Offer prompts and help: on the web, on phone or in person.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Think about who’s filling in the form	</h2>
  <p>Bear in mind that the person filling in the form might be the user, or a family member, carer or some other person helping the user. How might this affect your questions?</p>
  <p>For example, if you’re offering a callback service, rather than asking for “your” phone number or “their” phone number, ask “What number do you want us to call you on?”</p>

  <h2>Consider the effort involved in answering</h2>
  <p>Ask questions that users can answer easily. Think about where they will get their answer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>from their heads</li>
    <li>from information they have to hand</li>
    <li>by asking someone else - for example, arranging a witness</li>
    <li>by figuring something out</li>
  </ul>

<p>Users often have problems figuring things out. Here’s an example of a difficult question:</p>

<p>"What percentage of your working day do you spend doing moderate-intensity activities that cause
small increases in breathing or heart rate (such as brisk walking or carrying light loads) for at least 10 minutes continuously?"</p>

<p>To answer a question like this, the user has to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>understand the question</li>
  <li>think back or go and check things</li>
  <li>make a decision or estimate (some people find calculations like percentages difficult)</li>
  <li>answer the question</li>
</ul>
<p>They may guess or give up.</p>
