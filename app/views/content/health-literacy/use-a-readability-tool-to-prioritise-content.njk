  <p>It cannot tell you how easy your content is to understand. But it can show if the language might be too complex for many people.</p>

  <h2>Use the SMOG calculator</h2>
  <p>We use a tool called the SMOG calculator to measure readability.</p>
  <p>This uses the number of sentences and complex words (3 or more syllables) to give a readability score.</p>
  <p>Before using the SMOG calculator:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>add full stops to the end of every heading and bullet point</li>
  <li>if the title of the content includes a word with 3 or more syllables (for example, “paracetamol"), remove this word from the text</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This will help you get more accurate scores when comparing content.</p>

  {{ actionLink({
    "text": "Use the SMOG calculator",
    "href": "https://www.learningandwork.org.uk/SMOG-calculator/smogcalc.php"
  }) }}

  <h2>Prioritise content with a score over 14</h2>
  <p>The lower the score, the fewer complex words you're using.</p>
  <p>A score higher than 14 means most users might struggle with the language in your content.</p>

  <h2>Do not rely on readability scores alone</h2>

  <p>A readability score under 14 does not prove your content is useful for your users. It just means you're not using lots of complex words.</p>
  <p>Readability scores do not tell you if your content is easy to understand or act on.</p>
  <p>You can only find out how well your content works by testing it with users.</p>

  <h2>Improve your content</h2>
  <p>When you’ve identified content with a high readability score, look to improve it using:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the <a href="/service-manual/design-principles">NHS design principles</a></li>
    <li>our guidance about <a href="/service-manual/content/how-we-write">how to write for NHS digital services</a></li>
