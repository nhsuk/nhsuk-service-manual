      <h2 id="A">A</h2>
      <h3 id="A&E">A&amp;E</h3>
      <p>We use "A&amp;E". You don't need to spell out "accident and emergency".</p>
      <h3 id="abdomen-and-abdominal">abdomen and abdominal</h3>
      <p>It's OK to use "abdomen" where people are familiar with this term. For example, we know that pregnant women talk about "abdominal pain".</p>
      <p>If users may not be familiar with "abdomen" but are likely to hear their GP or another health professional use this word, we may add "abdomen" after "tummy". For example, "a dull ache in your tummy (abdomen)".</p>
      <h3 id="absorb">absorb</h3>
      <p>We use "take in".</p>
      <h3 id="acute">acute</h3>
      <p>We prefer "sudden", "starts suddenly", "in a short period of time" or, where appropriate, "short-term".</p>
      <p>We do use "acute" in the names of conditions like "acute lymphoblastic leukaemia". We also use it if our search analytics, user testing or survey feedback suggest that people will hear their doctor use the word "acute" or will search for it. If we use it, we explain what it means.</p>
      <h3 id="affects">affects</h3>
      <p>It’s alright to use "affects" but in some contexts, for example with medicines, it can be better to say that "something changes the way something else works". </p>
      <p>Check a dictionary if you’re not sure of the difference between "affect" and "effect".</p>
      <h3 id="age">age</h3>
      <p>Read about how we talk about age on the <a href="/content/inclusive-language#age">Inclusive language</a> page.</p>
      <h3 id="ageing">ageing</h3>
      <p>Not "aging".</p>
      <h3 id="alternative">alternative</h3>
      <p>We generally use "different" or "other".</p>
      <p>An exception is "complementary and alternative medicines".</p>
      <h3 id="Alzheimer’s-disease">Alzheimer’s disease</h3>
      <p>We capitalise the names of conditions that start with a proper name, like Alzheimer’s disease. Note the apostrophe.</p>
      <h3 id="ampersand-(&amp;)">ampersand (&amp;)</h3>
      <p>Avoid using an ampersand, except in "<a href="#A&E">A&amp;E</a>". Use "and" instead.</p>
      <h3 id="anonymised-anonymisation">anonymised, anonymisation</h3>
      <p>We prefer not to use these words.</p>
      <p>Instead we might explain what anonymisation means and talk about information that has personal details removed. We might give examples, like "When we share your information with another organisation, we take out all personal details, such as your name and address."</p>
      <p>Depending on your audience and the context, for example in a cookie banner, you might not need this much detail. A short, simple explanation might do.</p>
      <h3 id="antenatal">antenatal</h3>
      <p>One word without a hyphen.</p>
      <h3 id="anus">anus</h3>
      <p>We prefer "<a href="#bottom">bottom</a>" (as in "bleeding from your bottom") to "anus" or "<a href="#rectum">rectum</a>".</p>
      <p>You can add "anus" in brackets after "bottom". For example, in "enlarged blood vessels found inside or around the bottom (anus)".<p>
      <p>Or you can use "anus" on its own when you need to be more precise, for example when you're talking about anal cancer.</p>
      <p>User testing showed that people understand "bottom" better than "anus". They do search for "anus" in Google, however.</p>
      <h3 id="apply">apply</h3>
      <p>If we are talking about a medicine, we prefer "use", "put on" or "rub in".</p>

      <h2 id="B">B</h2>
      <h3 id="baby">baby</h3>
      <p>We use "baby" or "your baby" (not "unborn baby") in pregnancy content, from the early stages of pregnancy to birth and during the baby's first year. "Baby" is simpler than "embryo" or "foetus".</p>
      <p>For example, in our medicines content, we talk about how medicines can "affect you and your baby in pregnancy".</p>
      <p>The words we use depend on the context, however. In content about an unwanted pregnancy or abortion, for example, we use "pregnancy" and "ending the pregnancy". Test with users to make sure that the words you use are right for their circumstances.</p>
      <h3 id="back-passage">back passage</h3>
      <p>We do not use "back passage". Instead we use "<a href="#bottom">bottom</a>", "<a href="#anus">anus</a>" or, rarely, "<a href="#rectum">rectum</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="bacteria">bacteria</h3>
      <p>People often aren’t interested in the kind of bacteria that caused their problem. They want to know what to do about it. Only mention the name of the bacteria (full or short name) if your audience (users) need it.</p>
      <p>We do include the names of bacteria, for example, when we are writing for a more specialist audience, like when we’re explaining science news in <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/news/">Behind the Headlines</a>.</p>
      <p>If you give the full Latin name of a bacterium, capitalise the first word, for example, "Staphylococcus aureus" but put the shortened "staphylococcus" in lower case.</p>
      <p>Do not use italics.</p>
      <h3 id="baseline">baseline</h3>
      <p>One word.</p>
      <h3 id="bottle-feeding">bottle feeding</h3>
      <p>Two words.</p>

      <p>We prefer the word "bottom" (in phrases like "bleeding from your bottom") to "<a href="#anus">anus</a>" or "<a href="#rectum">rectum</a>".</p>
      <p>User testing showed that people understand "bottom" better than "anus".</p>

      <p> We use "burp" and "burping". We also use "<a href="#wind">wind</a>".</p>

      <h3 id="caesarean">caesarean</h3>
      <p>Lower case. </p>
      <h3 id="can't-or-cannot">can't or cannot</h3>
      <p>We use "cannot" instead of "can't".</p>
      <p>Read why in the <a href="/content/formatting-and-punctuation#contractions">contractions section</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="carer">carer</h3>
      <p>We use "carer" when we’re talking about a family member or friend who cares for someone but is not paid for this.</p>
      <p>We use "paid carer" for a carer who works for social services or another agency. A paid carer can help with personal care, for example getting washed and dressed.</p>
      <p>We don’t use "care worker" because we found that it is ambiguous.</p>
      <p>Compare "carer" and "<a href="#home-help">home help</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="cervical-screening">cervical screening</h3>
      <p>We prefer the term "cervical screening" to "smear test". But we add "smear test" in brackets the first time we mention cervical screening.</p>
      <p>"Smear test" is a dated term and the cervical screening programme no longer uses it. The invitation and results letters use "cervical screening" and our content reflects that.</p>
      <p>We've seen anecdotal evidence from Public Health England, cervical screening service providers and smear takers that some users find the word "smear" off-putting.</p>
      <h3 id="chemist">chemist</h3>
      <p>We use "pharmacy", not "chemist". Our users are more likely to look for the word "pharmacy".</p>
      <h3 id="chronic">chronic</h3>
      <p>We prefer "for a long time" or "does not go away".</p>
      <p>We have seen evidence that the word "chronic" confuses people. Some people think it means "bad" or "serious".</p>
      <p>We do use "chronic" in the names of conditions like "chronic fatigue syndrome". We also use it if our search analytics, user testing or survey feedback suggest that people will hear their doctor use the word "chronic" or will search for it. If we use it, we explain what "chronic" means.</p>
      <h3 id="CJD">CJD</h3>
      <p>We use "CJD" – or "variant CJD (vCJD)" as the human form of BSE.</p>
      <p>Use full name "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease" when you first mention CJD.</p>
      <p>We do not use "mad cow disease" or "BSE".</p>
      <h3 id="clinical-commissioning-groups-(CCGs)">clinical commissioning groups (CCGs)</h3>
      <p>Lower case, except when you are referring to a particular CCG. For example:  Anytown Clinical Commissioning Group.</p>
      <h3 id="condition">condition</h3>
      <p>We use "condition", "problem" or "illness".</p>
      <p>We avoid words like "disease" and "disorder" as they can sound negative. But we do use these words in the names of specific diseases or disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or terms like "tropical diseases".</p>
      <p>Read about how we talk about disabilities and conditions on the <a href="/content/inclusive-language#disabilities-and-conditions">Inclusive language</a> page.</p>
      <h3 id="continuing-healthcare">continuing healthcare</h3>
      <p>Lower case and "healthcare" is one word.</p>
      <p>We explain <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/money-work-and-benefits/nhs-continuing-healthcare/">NHS continuing healthcare</a> on the NHS website.</p>
      <h3 id="coronavirus-(covid-19)">coronavirus (COVID-19)</h3>
      <p>Coronavirus is the virus that causes the illness COVID-19. Write coronavirus in lower case.</p>
      <p>We use the full term "coronavirus (COVID-19)" when we first mention the illness but after that we use "coronavirus" as that is what most people call it and search for.</p>
      <h3 id="CT-scan">CT scan</h3>
      <p>You don’t need to spell it out. The abbreviation is fine.</p>

      <h3 id="diuretics">diuretics</h3>
      <p>We don’t call them "water tablets". We explain that diuretics are "tablets that make you pee more".</p>
      <h3 id="DNA">DNA</h3>
      <p>It’s OK to use the abbreviation.</p>
      <h3 id="doctor">doctor</h3>
      <p>We mostly use "<a href="#GP">GP</a>". We use "doctor" when someone might see a GP, a specialist or consultant in a surgery, hospital or clinic setting. We also use "doctor" when we’re writing about healthcare abroad.</p>
      <p>We use "your doctor" when we're writing about follow-up or ongoing care with a health professional, for example, when a doctor is prescribing and monitoring medicine.</p>
      <p>We use phrases like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"talk with your doctor"</li>
        <li>"follow your doctor's instructions"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also see "<a href="#specialist">specialist</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="don't-or-do-not">don't or do not</h3>
      <p>We use "do not" instead of "don't".</p>
      <p>Read why in the <a href="/content/formatting-and-punctuation#contractions">contractions section</a>.</p>
      <p>We use "Don't" in headings for <a href="/design-system/components/do-and-dont-lists">Do and Don't lists</a>. But we use "do not" for the commands in the list.<p>
      <h3 id="dosage">dosage</h3>

      <h3 id="drowsy">drowsy</h3>
      <p>Generally, we prefer the word "sleepy" to "drowsy" as people are more likely to search for "sleepy". But "drowsy" may be better if you're writing about feeling unusually sleepy in the daytime, particularly in the context of medicines.</p>
      <p>In information about medicines, for example antihistamines, we prefer the terms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"drowsy (sedating)" to describe a medicine because these are the words people search for and see or hear in a GP or pharmacy setting</li>
        <li>"feeling sleepy (drowsy)" to describe a side effect</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="drugs">drugs</h3>

      <p>We use "<a href="#wind">wind</a>" for "trapped wind" or bloating.</p>
      <h3 id="fever">fever</h3>
      <p>We prefer the words "high <a href="#temperature">temperature</a>" to "fever", for example in a list of symptoms. Our user research shows that "fever" is not a well understood word.</p>
      <p>But we still use it when we’re writing specifically about fever or different types of fever (such as scarlet fever).</p>
      <h3 id="fit">fit</h3>
      <p>See <a href="#seizure-or-fit">seizure or fit</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="flatulence">flatulence</h3>
      <p>We prefer "<a href="#fart">farting</a>" to "flatulence".</p>
      <p>We only use "flatulence" when we need to for clinical content (for example, in a health information page about flatulence). We explain that flatulence is the same as <a href="#wind">wind</a> or farting.</p>
      <h3 id="flu">flu</h3>
      <p>Not "influenza". No apostrophe.</p>
      <h3 id="flu-jab-or-flu-vaccine">flu jab or flu vaccine</h3>
      <p>We sometimes use "flu jab" for adults, because people search for this. But we use "flu vaccine" for children. (The child vaccine is a spray.)</p>
      <p>People who are looking for information about flu vaccination in pregnancy search for "jab".</p>
      <p>For the annual flu vaccination programme, we use the term "flu vaccine" as that covers children and adults.</p>
      <h3 id="foetus">foetus</h3>
      <p>We do not commonly use "foetus", except in the names of conditions like "foetal alcohol syndrome". We prefer "<a href="#baby">baby</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="food-pipe">food pipe</h3>
      <p>We use "food pipe", not "gullet".</p>

      <h3 id="formula">formula</h3>
      <p>We use "formula" or "baby formula", not "infant formula".</p>
      <h3 id="formulations">formulations</h3>
      <p>Rather than talking about different medicines formulations, we talk about "different types" (for example, of hydrocortisone) or "different ways" of using a medicine.</p>
      <h3 id="foundation-trusts">foundation trust</h3>
      <p>Lower case, unless you are giving the full name of a foundation trust. For example: Anytown NHS Foundation Trust.</p>

      <p>We don't use "gas". Instead we talk about "<a href="#wind">wind</a>", "<a href="#burp">burping</a>" or "<a href="#fart">farting</a>". </p>

      <p>Read about how we talk about gender on the <a href="/content/inclusive-language#sex-gender-sexuality">Inclusive language</a> page.</p>
      <h3 id="GP">GP</h3>
      <p>We mostly use "GP". We use "<a href="#doctor">doctor</a>", where someone may see either a GP or another health professional like a specialist or consultant in a surgery, hospital or clinic setting. We also use "doctor" when we're writing about healthcare abroad.</p>
      <h4>a GP</h4>
      <p>We use "a GP" (rather than "your GP") when we're advising people to get medical advice, care or treatment, for example in a <a href="/design-system/components/care-cards">care card</a>. This is particularly important when the user may need urgent care or to act out of hours.</p>
      <p>Not all users are registered with a GP or have a regular GP. We use "a GP" to emphasise that users should get help and that it doesn't matter which GP they see.</p>
      <p>Once we've used "a GP", we follow up with "the GP". For example: "Talk to a GP about your condition. The GP might suggest...".</p>
      <h4>your GP</h4>
      <p>We use "your GP" when the user is likely to be under a GP's ongoing care, for example, for a condition like diabetes or in the context of follow-up care.</p>
      <p>We also use "your GP" rather than "a GP" in a transactional journey, such as NHS 111 online, where we have information about the user and we are referring them to their GP during office hours.</p>
      <h3 id="GP-surgery">GP surgery</h3>
      <p>When we’re writing for the public, we use "GP surgery" or "surgery" rather than "practice", because our research shows us that this is the word patients are more likely to search for and use.</p><p>When we’re writing for healthcare staff, we may use the term "GP practice" or "practice" for short. For example, for "practice managers".</p>
      <p>Note that a GP practice can have more than 1 surgery.</p>
      <h3 id="gullet">gullet</h3>
      <p>We use "food pipe".</p>

      <p>We use "health record" rather than "medical record". "Health record" is more accurate as someone's record may cover social care as well as medical content. In our user research, we haven’t seen anyone confused by "health record". People see it as the same as a "medical record".</p>
      <p>In some contexts, for example in forms, rather than asking about someone's "health record", we ask about "your health, and any health problems or treatments you've had in the past".</p>

      <p>We only use the microgram symbol (μg) if people will find it helpful, for example, if they will see it on their medicines or vitamins packet. In cases like these, we add the following when we first mention micrograms: "The word microgram is sometimes written with the Greek symbol μ followed by the letter g (μg)." We explain that it’s a Greek symbol so that people who use screen readers understand it when they hear an unexpected sound.</p>

      <p>Write the NHS number as 3 groups of numbers, with a single space between them, like this: 485 777 3456. (This is an example or test number.)</p>
      <p>The format is 3 3 4: 2 groups of 3 digits followed by 4 digits.</p>
      <p>Make sure that you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>use this format whenever you include an example or include an NHS number</li>
        <li>keep the NHS number on 1 line - do not allow it to break over 2 lines</li>
        <li>only use a space as a separator - do not use dashes or dots</li>
        <li>do not use a real NHS number as an example - use 485 777 3456 or 123 456 7890</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This number format makes it easier for people and assistive technologies to read. It also makes it less likely that people will make mistakes.</p>
      <p>Ask your frontend or coding colleagues how to stop the NHS number breaking over 2 lines.</p>

      <h3 id="outpatient">outpatient</h3>
      <p>One word. Like inpatient.</p>
      <h3 id="over-the-counter-or-OTC">over the counter or OTC</h3>
      <p>We say "medicine you buy (from a pharmacy or shop)".</p>
      <p>We put pharmacies first, ahead of supermarkets and shops.</p>

      <p>See "<a href="#people-or-patients">people or patients</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="pee">pee</h3>
      <p>We use the nouns "pee" and "urine". We know that everyone can understand "pee", including people who find reading difficult. Most people also understand and search for "urine", for example in phrases like "blood in urine". </p>
      <p>We don’t use "wee" because it can confuse people who use voice technologies or screen readers.</p>
      <p>We use "pee" for the verb, not "urinate" or "pass urine". We know that the people who use NHS digital services talk about and search for "peeing more often" and "peeing at night".</p>
      <h3 id="people-or-patients">people or patients</h3>
      <p>Generally, we address people as "you".</p>
      <p>If we're writing in the third person, we mostly use "people" but this varies depending on the context. "People" is a broad term which covers patients, carers, their family and friends.</p>
      <p>We prefer "people" for content aimed at the general public but we sometimes use "patients" if the word "people" might be confusing, for example, where we need to distinguish patients from the general public.</p>
      <p>"Patients" may also be more suitable in content for health professionals.</p>
      <h3 id="percentages">percentages</h3>

      <h3 id="personal-child-health-record-(red-book)">personal child health record (red book)</h3>
      <p>All lower case. We include the phrase "red book" in brackets the first time we mention "personal child health record". Then we usually call it the "red book" after the first mention.</p>
      <p>Also see <a href="#health-record">health record</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="pharmacy">pharmacy</h3>
      <p>We use "pharmacy", not "chemist". Our users are more likely to look for the word "pharmacy".</p>
      <h3 id="PMS-(premenstrual-syndrome)">PMS (premenstrual syndrome)</h3>
      <p>We prefer "PMS" instead of "premenstrual syndrome". PMS is a commonly understood term and it is used more often than "premenstrual syndrome". But we should write it as "PMS (premenstrual syndrome)" at the first mention to make it clear what PMS stands for.</p>
      <p>We do not say "premenstrual tension" or "PMT" as these terms are more dated and users do not search for these as much as PMS.</p>
      <h3 id="poo">poo</h3>
      <p>We mostly use "poo", rather than "stool". We know that everyone can understand "poo", including people who find reading difficult.</p>
      <p>We don’t use "opening your bowels" or "bowel movements".</p>
      <p>We sometimes use the words "stool" or "bowel" when people will hear their GP use them. But we will explain the term or phrase.  For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"a sample of poo (stool sample)"</li>
        <li>"Bowel incontinence can affect people in different ways. You may have a problem if you have sudden urges to poo that you can't control."</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="practice">practice</h3>
      <p>"Practice" is the noun, as in "GP practice". "Practise" is a verb. For example: "Practise pelvic floor exercises".</p>
      <p>When we’re writing for the public, we use "surgery" rather than "practice", because our research shows us that this is the word patients are more likely to search for and use.</p>
      <p>When we’re writing for healthcare staff, we may use the word "practice". For example, for "practice managers".</p>
      <p>Note that a GP practice can have more than 1 surgery.</p>
      <h3 id="pre-school">pre-school</h3>
      <p>With a hyphen.</p>
      <h3 id="preconception-care">preconception care</h3>
      <p>We prefer "planning your pregnancy" or "thinking about your health before you get pregnant" or just "getting pregnant". This is the kind of language our users use.</p>
      <p>Clinicians sometimes use "preconception care" when they're talking about women who need special care before they get pregnant - for example, changes to their medicine. We do not use "preconception care" as a topic. Instead we give specific advice where people need it, for example: "Talk to your doctor if you want to get pregnant. It's best to stop taking [name of medicine] at least 3 months before you start trying for a baby."</p>

      <h3 id="safe-and-safer">safe and safer</h3>
      <p>Beware of saying "safe drinking" or "safe sex".</p>
      <p>It’s hard to know what is really "safe" so we talk about "safer sex" or "safer drinking". That suggests that people can lower but not necessarily get rid of the risk altogether.</p>
      <h3 id="safety-precaution">safety precaution</h3>
      <p>We say "for safety".</p>

      <p>We say "ask for".</p>
      <h3 id="seizure-or-fit">seizure or fit</h3>
      <p>We add the word "fit" after "seizure" ("seizure or fit") in content about epilepsy, brain cancer and brain tumours. We know that "seizure" is the word that people with epilepsy use, understand and generally prefer and that it's not the same as a "fit" (which is a kind of seizure that makes the body jerk and shake uncontrollably). But some of our users don't understand the word "seizure" and including the word "fit" when we first mention seizures helps them.</p>
      <p>In general content, for example, with medicines that might make people jerk and shake uncontrollably as a side effect, we use the term "seizure or fit" and explain that this is what we mean.</p>
      <h3 id="service-user">service user</h3>
      <p>We prefer "<a href="#people-or-patients">people" or "patients</a>" - or in social services "people who use services".</p>
      <p>In general content, for example, about medicines that might make people jerk and shake uncontrollably as a side effect, we always use the term "seizure or fit" and explain that this is what we mean.</p>
      <h3 id="setting">setting</h3>
      <p>We avoid the term "hospital setting". We just say "in hospital".</p>
      <p>Instead of "community setting", we mention the place, for example, "in school", "in a clinic" or "at home".</p>
      <h3 id="sex-and-sexuality">sex and sexuality</h3>
      <p>Read about how we talk about sex, gender and sexuality on the <a href="/content/inclusive-language#sex-gender-sexuality">Inclusive language</a> page.</p>
      <h3 id="sex-assigned-or-registered-at-birth">sex assigned or registered at birth</h3>
      <p>We use the phrase "sex assigned at birth" when we're talking about trans health and gender dysphoria, as this is the language our audience uses. In other cases, we use "the sex someone was registered with at birth" because user research shows that most people understand this better as it refers to an actual event.</p>
      <h3 id="sexual-health-clinic">sexual health clinic</h3>
      <p>We use "sexual health clinic", not "STI clinic".</p>
      <p>Sexual health clinics can offer different services. So, when we mention them for the first time and are talking about STIs, we sometimes add that they may also be called "GUM clinics". When we are talking about contraception, we sometimes add that they may also be called "family planning or contraception clinics".</p>
      <p>Also see "<a href="#STI">STI</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="sick">sick</h3>
      <p>We use "feeling sick" instead of "nausea", but you may want to put "nausea" in brackets afterwards: feeling sick (nausea).</p>
      <p>We use "being sick" instead of "vomiting". Again, you may want to put "vomiting" in brackets afterwards: being sick (vomiting).</p>
      <p>We use "vomiting" in phrases like "vomiting blood".</p>
      <p>We use "vomit" as the noun. For example, "blood in your vomit".</p>
      <h3 id="side-effects">side effects</h3>
      <p>Two words.</p>
      <p>We say that people may "get" or "have" side effects, not "develop" or "experience" them.</p>
      <p>Check a dictionary if you’re not sure of the difference between "affect" and "effect".</p>
      <h3 id="sleepy">sleepy</h3>
      <p>Generally, we prefer the word "sleepy" to "drowsy" as people are more likely to search for "sleepy". But "<a href="#drowsy">drowsy</a>" may be better if you're writing about feeling unusually sleepy in the daytime, particularly in the context of medicines.</p>
      <h3 id="smear-test">smear test</h3>
      <p>We prefer "<a href="#cervical-screening">cervical screening</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="specialist">specialist</h3>

      <h3 id="STI">STI</h3>
      <p>You might want to spell out "sexually transmitted infection" the first time you mention it. Otherwise it’s fine to use the abbreviation STI.</p>
      <p>We talk about "a" sexually transmitted infection but "an" STI.</p>
      <p>We don’t use the terms "sexually transmitted disease" or "STD".</p>
      <p>Also see "<a href="#sexual-health-clinic">sexual health clinic</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="stomach">stomach</h3>
      <p>We use "stomach" for the internal organ and in some common phrases like "stomach ache" and "stomach bug".<p>
      <p>We sometimes use "<a href="#tummy">tummy</a>" for short, for example in "tummy bug".</p>
      <p>Also see "<a href="#abdomen-and-abdominal">abdomen</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="stool">stool</h3>
      <p>See <a href="#poo">poo</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="suffering-from">suffering from</h3>
      <p>We don’t use "suffering from". We talk about people having or living with a disability or condition.</p>
      <p>Read more about how we talk about disabilities and conditions on the <a href="/content/inclusive-language#disabilities-and-conditions">Inclusive language</a> page.</p>
      <h3 id="summary-care-record">summary care record</h3>
      <p>Lower case.</p>
      <p>For a professional audience (people who will know the abbreviation already), it’s OK to use SCR after the first mention of a summary care record. (It's "an", not "a", SCR.)</p>
      <p>For the public, we avoid the abbreviation. Instead it may be better to say: "your <a href="#health-record">health record</a>" or "a summary of your health record".</p>
      <h3 id="surgery">surgery</h3>
      <p>When we’re writing for the public, we use "GP surgery" or "surgery" rather than "practice", because our research shows us that this is the word patients are more likely to search for and use.</p>
      <p>When we’re writing for healthcare staff, we may use the word "practice". For example, for "practice managers".</p>
      <p>Note that a practice can have more than 1 surgery.</p>
      <h3 id="symptoms">symptoms</h3>
      <p>We say that people may "get" or "have" symptoms, not "develop" or "experience" them.</p>

      <h3 id="temperature">temperature</h3>
      <p>We avoid giving a specific temperature in most cases. This is because it's normal for people's temperature to rise when they are ill or have an infection. How much their temperature changes varies from person to person. So we don't focus on a particular temperature.</p>
      <p>In a list of symptoms, we say "a high temperature" or "if your child is feeling hotter than usual if you touch their neck, back or tummy".</p>
      <p>When we’re telling people to do something about a high temperature in an adult or a child over 6 months old, for example in a <a href="/design-system/components/care-cards">care card</a>, we say:</p>
      <ul><li>"if your temperature is very high, or you feel hot or shivery"</li>
          <li>"if your child's temperature is very high, or they feel hot or shivery"</li></ul>
      <p>The exception is when talking about the temperature of a child under 6 months old. In these cases we state a specific temperature and say:</p>
      <ul><li>"if your child is under 3 months old and has a temperature of 38C or higher, or you think they have a high temperature"</li>
      <li>"if your child is 3 to 6 months old and has a temperature of 39C or higher, or you think they have a high temperature"</li></ul>

      <h3 id="terminal">terminal</h3>
      <p>We use "terminal" when a condition or illness is likely to lead to death. We find that people with cancer, for example, often use this word.</p>
      <h3 id="time">time</h3>
      <p>See our guidance on time on the <a href="/content/numbers-measurements-dates-time#time">Numbers, measurements, dates and time</a> page.</p>

      <p>We prefer "try to" to "try and".</p>
      <h3 id="tummy">tummy</h3>
      <p>Some users feel that "tummy" is childish but it can work well in content about children.</p>
      <p>It can also be a good alternative to abdomen when you’re talking about the outside of the body (a broader area than the stomach).</p>

      <p>The exception is the "flu jab". We sometimes use "flu jab" for adults, because people search for this. But we use "flu vaccine" for children, because the child vaccine is a spray.</p>
      <p>For the annual flu vaccination programme, we use the term "flu vaccine" as that covers children and adults.</p>
      <h3 id="vomiting">vomiting</h3>
      <p>We use "being sick" instead of "vomiting". You may want to put "vomiting" in brackets afterwards: being sick (vomiting).</p>
      <p>We use "vomiting" in phrases like "vomiting blood".</p>
      <p>We use "vomit" as the noun. For example, "blood in your vomit".</p>
