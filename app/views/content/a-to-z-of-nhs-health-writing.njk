      <h2 id="A">A</h2>
      <h3 id="A&E">A&amp;E</h3>
      <p>We use "A&amp;E". You do not need to spell out "accident and emergency".</p>
      <h3 id="abbreviations">abbreviations</h3>
      <p>See the guidance on <a href="/content/formatting-and-punctuation#abbreviations-and-acronyms">abbreviations and acronyms on the Formatting and punctuation page</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="abdomen-and-abdominal">abdomen and abdominal</h3>
      <p>It's OK to use "abdomen" where people are familiar with this term. For example, we know that pregnant women talk about "abdominal pain".</p>
      <p>If users may not be familiar with "abdomen" but are likely to hear their GP or another health professional use this word, we may add "abdomen" after "tummy". For example, "a dull ache in your tummy (abdomen)".</p>
      <h3 id="absorb">absorb</h3>
      <p>We use "take in".</p>
      <h3 id="accessibility">accessibility</h3>
      <p>Follow our <a href="/accessibility">accessibility guidance</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="acronyms">acronyms</h3>
      <p>See the guidance on <a href="/content/formatting-and-punctuation#abbreviations-and-acronyms">abbreviations and acronyms on the Formatting and punctuation page</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="acute">acute</h3>
      <p>We prefer "sudden", "starts suddenly", "in a short period of time" or, where appropriate, "short-term".</p>
      <p>We do use "acute" in the names of conditions like "acute lymphoblastic leukaemia". We also use it if our search analytics, user testing or survey feedback suggest that people will hear their doctor use the word "acute" or will search for it. If we use it, we explain what it means.</p>
      <h3 id="affects">affects</h3>
      <p>It's alright to use "affects" but in some contexts, for example with medicines, it can be better to say that "something changes the way something else works". </p>
      <p>Check a dictionary if you're not sure of the difference between "affect" and "effect".</p>
      <h3 id="age">age</h3>
      <p>Find out how we talk about <a href="/content/inclusive-content/age">age in the Inclusive content section</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="ageing">ageing</h3>
      <p>Not "aging".</p>
      <h3 id="alternative">alternative</h3>
      <p>We generally use "different" or "other".</p>
      <p>An exception is "complementary and alternative medicines".</p>
      <h3 id="Alzheimer's-disease">Alzheimer's disease</h3>
      <p>We capitalise the names of conditions that start with a proper name, like Alzheimer's disease. Note the apostrophe.</p>
      <h3 id="ampersand-(&amp;)">ampersand (&amp;)</h3>
      <p>Avoid using an ampersand, except in "<a href="#A&E">A&amp;E</a>". Use "and" instead.</p>
      <h3 id="anonymised-anonymisation">anonymised, anonymisation</h3>
      <p>We prefer not to use these words.</p>
      <p>Instead we might explain what anonymisation means and talk about information that has personal details removed. We might give examples, like "When we share your information with another organisation, we take out all personal details, such as your name and address."</p>
      <p>Depending on your audience and the context, for example in a cookie banner, you might not need this much detail. A short, simple explanation might do.</p>
      <h3 id="antenatal">antenatal</h3>
      <p>One word without a hyphen.</p>
      <h3 id="anus">anus</h3>
      <p>We prefer "<a href="#bottom">bottom</a>" (as in "bleeding from your bottom") to "anus" or "<a href="#rectum">rectum</a>".</p>
      <p>You can add "anus" in brackets after "bottom". For example, in "enlarged blood vessels found inside or around the bottom (anus)".</p>
      <p>Or you can use "anus" on its own when you need to be more precise, for example when you're talking about anal cancer.</p>
      <p>User testing showed that people understand "bottom" better than "anus". They do search for "anus" in Google, however.</p>
      <h3 id="apply">apply</h3>
      <p>If we are talking about a medicine, we prefer "use", "put on" or "rub in".</p>
      <h3 id="apostrophes">apostrophes</h3>
      <p>See the guidance on <a href="/content/formatting-and-punctuation#apostrophes">apostrophes on the Formatting and punctuation page</a>.</p>

    <div class="nhsuk-a-z-list--results-items">
      <h2 id="B">B</h2>
      <h3 id="baby">baby</h3>
      <p>We use "baby" or "your baby" (not "unborn baby") in pregnancy content, from the early stages of pregnancy to birth and during the baby's first year. "Baby" is simpler than "embryo" or "foetus".</p>
      <p>For example, in our medicines content, we talk about how medicines can "affect you and your baby in pregnancy".</p>
      <p>The words we use depend on the context, however. In content about an unwanted pregnancy or abortion, for example, we use "pregnancy" and "ending the pregnancy". Test with users to make sure that the words you use are right for their circumstances.</p>
      <h3 id="back-passage">back passage</h3>
      <p>We do not use "back passage". Instead we use "<a href="#bottom">bottom</a>", "<a href="#anus">anus</a>" or, rarely, "<a href="#rectum">rectum</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="bacteria">bacteria</h3>
      <p>People often are not interested in the kind of bacteria that caused their problem. They want to know what to do about it. Only mention the name of the bacteria (full or short name) if your audience (users) need it.</p>
      <p>If you give the full Latin name of a bacterium, capitalise the first word, for example, "Staphylococcus aureus" but put the shortened "staphylococcus" in lower case.</p>
      <p>Do not use italics.</p>
      <h3 id="BAME">BAME</h3>
      <p>Use "ethnic minorities", not "BAME" or "BME".</p>
      <p>Find out how we talk about <a href="/content/inclusive-content/ethnicity-religion-and-nationality">ethnicity, religion and nationality in the Inclusive content section</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="baseline">baseline</h3>
      <p>One word.</p>
      <h3 id="Black-or-black">Black or black</h3>
      <p>Use a capital letter when you're writing about ethnicity or when you're asking users for their ethnic group.</p>
      <p>Use lower-case when you're writing about skin colour.</p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Black, Asian, African, Black British or Caribbean"</li>
        <li>"On white skin the rash can appear red, but on brown and black skin the rash may be harder to see."</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="black-skin">black skin</h3>
      <p>We talk about skin colour clearly and use terms that are easy to understand, including "brown and black skin". We do not refer to brown or black skin as "dark" or "darker".</p>
      <p>See the guidance on <a href="/content/inclusive-content/skin-symptoms">skin symptoms in the Inclusive content section</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="BME">BME</h3>
      <p>Use "ethnic minorities", not "BAME" or "BME".</p>

      <h3 id="bold">bold</h3>
      <p>See the guidance on how we use <a href="/content/formatting-and-punctuation#bold">bold on the Formatting and punctuation page</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="booster">booster</h3>
      <p>A booster is a dose of a <a href="#vaccine">vaccine</a> that increases or renews the effect of a vaccine you had earlier.</p>
      <p>Explain in more detail the 1st time you mention it, for example "a booster dose of the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine". Then you can refer to it as a "booster" or "booster dose".</p>
      <h3 id="bottle-feeding">bottle feeding</h3>
      <p>Two words.</p>
      <h3 id="bottom">bottom</h3>
      <p>We prefer the word "bottom" (in phrases like "bleeding from your bottom") to "<a href="#anus">anus</a>" or "<a href="#rectum">rectum</a>".</p>
      <p>User testing showed that people understand "bottom" better than "anus".</p>
      <h3 id="bowel-movement">bowel movement</h3>
      <p>See <a href="#poo">poo</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="Braille">Braille</h3>
      <p>Starts with a capital letter.</p>
      <h3 id="breast-milk">breast milk</h3>
      <p>Two words.</p>
      <h3 id="breastfeeding">breastfeeding</h3>
      <p>One word.</p>
      <h3 id="brown-skin">brown skin</h3>
      <p>We talk about skin colour clearly and use terms that are easy to understand, including "brown and black skin". We do not refer to brown or black skin as "dark" or "darker".</p>

      <h3 id="bum">bum</h3>
      <p>We prefer "<a href="#bottom">bottom</a>" (in phrases like "bleeding from your bottom").</p>
      <h3 id="burp">burp</h3>
      <p>We use "burp" and "burping". We also use "<a href="#wind">wind</a>".</p>

      <h3 id="can't-or-cannot">can't or cannot</h3>
      <p>We use "cannot" instead of "can't".</p>

      <h3 id="capital-letters">capital letters</h3>

      <h3 id="carer">carer</h3>
      <p>We use "carer" when we're talking about a family member or friend who cares for someone but is not paid for this.</p>
      <p>We use "paid carer" for a carer who works for social services or another agency. A paid carer can help with personal care, for example getting washed and dressed.</p>
      <p>We do not use "care worker" because we found that it is ambiguous.</p>
      <p>Compare "carer" and "<a href="#home-help">home help</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="cervical-screening">cervical screening</h3>
      <p>We prefer the term "cervical screening" to "smear test". But we add "smear test" in brackets the first time we mention cervical screening.</p>
      <p>"Smear test" is a dated term and the cervical screening programme no longer uses it. The invitation and results letters use "cervical screening" and our content reflects that.</p>
      <p>We've seen anecdotal evidence from Public Health England, cervical screening service providers and smear takers that some users find the word "smear" off-putting.</p>
      <h3 id="chemist">chemist</h3>
      <p>We use "pharmacy", not "chemist". Our users are more likely to look for the word "pharmacy".</p>
      <h3 id="chronic">chronic</h3>
      <p>We prefer "for a long time" or "does not go away".</p>
      <p>We have seen evidence that the word "chronic" confuses people. Some people think it means "bad" or "serious".</p>
      <p>We do use "chronic" in the names of conditions like "chronic fatigue syndrome". We also use it if our search analytics, user testing or survey feedback suggest that people will hear their doctor use the word "chronic" or will search for it. If we use it, we explain what "chronic" means.</p>
      <h3 id="CJD">CJD</h3>
      <p>We use "CJD" – or "variant CJD (vCJD)" as the human form of BSE.</p>
      <p>Use full name "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease" when you first mention CJD.</p>
      <p>We do not use "mad cow disease" or "BSE".</p>
      <h3 id="clinical-commissioning-groups-(CCGs)">clinical commissioning groups (CCGs)</h3>
      <p>Lower case, except when you are referring to a particular CCG. For example:  Anytown Clinical Commissioning Group.</p>
      <h3 id="clinical-systems">clinical systems</h3>
      <p>See <a href="#GP-system-supplier-names-and-patient-facing-services">GP system supplier names and patient-facing services</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="condition">condition</h3>
      <p>We use "condition", "problem" or "illness".</p>
      <p>We avoid words like "disease" and "disorder" as they can sound negative. But we do use these words in the names of specific diseases or disorders, like Alzheimer's disease or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or terms like "tropical diseases".</p>

      <h3 id="Deaf-people">Deaf people</h3>
      <p>If you're creating content for or about people who are Deaf and use British Sign Language to communicate, bear in mind that their needs will be different from those of people who have a hearing loss or tinnitus.</p>
      <p>We use a capital D when we're talking to or about people who are Deaf and use British Sign Language to communicate because many Deaf people prefer it.</p>
      <p>We recognise that this doesn't apply to everyone who comes to the NHS for information about deafness and so, as always, we check with the people we're creating content for how they want to be described.</p>
      <h3 id="deafness">deafness</h3>
      <p>We use "deafness" (with a lower case d) in our health content when we're writing about it, for example, as a symptom. But we prefer the term "<a href="#hearing-loss">hearing loss</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="death">death</h3>
      <p>Be direct wherever possible.</p>
      <p>Say "death" instead of:
      <ul>
        <li>"fatality"</li>
        <li>"passing"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not use "loss" and "bereavement" as euphemisms for death. We do use them when we are talking about feelings of loss or grieving in our mental health content.</p>
      <p>Say "died" instead of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"passed away"</li>
        <li>"deceased"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not recommend this language in cases of miscarriage or abortion, however. We are working on guidance on this.</p>
      <h3 id="degrees-(temperature)">degrees (temperature)</h3>
      <p>We use C for centigrade or Celsius – for example, 38C or &minus;4C. Do not include the degree symbol (&deg;).</p>
      <p>We are no longer including references to <a href="#Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a>.</p>
      <p>Also see <a href="#fever">fever</a> and <a href="#temperature">temperature</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="diabetic">diabetic</h3>
      <p>We do not talk about people as "diabetic". We say they have diabetes.</p>
      <p>We do use "diabetic" in phrases like "diabetic eye screening".</p>

      <h3 id="DNA">DNA</h3>
      <p>It's OK to use the abbreviation.</p>
      <h3 id="doctor">doctor</h3>
      <p>We mostly use "<a href="#GP">GP</a>". We use "doctor" when someone might see a GP, a specialist or consultant in a surgery, hospital or clinic setting. We also use "doctor" when we're writing about healthcare abroad.</p>
      <p>We use "your doctor" when we're writing about follow-up or ongoing care with a health professional, for example, when a doctor is prescribing and monitoring medicine.</p>
      <p>We use phrases like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"talk with your doctor"</li>
        <li>"follow your doctor's instructions"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also see "<a href="#specialist">specialist</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="don't-or-do-not">don't or do not</h3>
      <p>We use "do not" instead of "don't".</p>
      <p>Read why in the <a href="/content/formatting-and-punctuation#contractions">contractions section</a>.</p>
      <p>We use "Don't" in headings for <a href="/design-system/components/do-and-dont-lists">Do and Don't lists</a>. But we use "do not" for the commands in the list.</p>
      <h3 id="dosage">dosage</h3>
      <p>See <a href="/content/numbers-measurements-dates-time#dosage">dosage on our Numbers, measurements, dates and time page</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="drowsy">drowsy</h3>
      <p>Generally, we prefer the word "sleepy" to "drowsy" as people are more likely to search for "sleepy". But "drowsy" may be better if you're writing about feeling unusually sleepy in the daytime, particularly in the context of medicines.</p>
      <p>In information about medicines, for example antihistamines, we prefer the terms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"drowsy (sedating)" to describe a medicine because these are the words people search for and see or hear in a GP or pharmacy setting</li>
        <li>"feeling sleepy (drowsy)" to describe a side effect</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="drugs">drugs</h3>
      <p>We use "medicines".</p>
      <p>We only use "drugs" for illegal drugs.</p>

      <h3 id="Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</h3>
      <p>We are taking references to Fahrenheit out of our content and just using Celsius. This is because healthcare professionals in the UK use Celsius. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also uses it and we refer to NICE for evidence-based guidance.</p>
      <p>Celsius has been the official <a href="#temperature">temperature</a> scale in the UK since 1965.</p>
      <p>Giving 2 different temperatures can confuse people who may be anxious or unwell. It's easier to have just one number to tell your GP.</p>
      <h3 id="fart">fart</h3>
      <p>We use "fart" and "farting" when we're talking about symptoms. People understand "fart" better than "passing wind" or "<a href="#flatulence">flatulence</a>".</p>
      <p>We use "<a href="#wind">wind</a>" for "trapped wind" or bloating.</p>
      <h3 id="fever">fever</h3>
      <p>We prefer the words "high <a href="#temperature">temperature</a>" to "fever", for example in a list of symptoms. Our user research shows that "fever" is not a well understood word.</p>
      <p>But we still use it when we're writing specifically about fever or different types of fever (such as scarlet fever).</p>

      <p>We only use "flatulence" when we need to for clinical content (for example, in a health information page about flatulence). We explain that flatulence is the same as <a href="#wind">wind</a> or farting.</p>
      <h3 id="flu">flu</h3>

      <p>People who are looking for information about flu vaccination in pregnancy search for "jab".</p>
      <p>For the annual flu vaccination programme, we use the term "flu vaccine" as that covers children and adults.</p>
      <h3 id="foetus">foetus</h3>

      <p>We mostly use "GP". We use "<a href="#doctor">doctor</a>", where someone may see either a GP or another health professional like a specialist or consultant in a surgery, hospital or clinic setting. We also use "doctor" when we're writing about healthcare abroad.</p>
      <h4>a GP</h4>
      <p>We use "a GP" (rather than "your GP") when we're advising people to get medical advice, care or treatment, for example in a care card. (Find out more about <a href="/design-system/patterns/help-users-decide-when-and-where-to-get-care">helping users decide when and where to get care, with care cards</a>.) This is particularly important when the user may need urgent care or to act out of hours.</p>
      <p>Not all users are registered with a GP or have a regular GP. We use "a GP" to emphasise that users should get help and that it doesn't matter which GP they see.</p>
      <p>Once we've used "a GP", we follow up with "the GP". For example: "Talk to a GP about your condition. The GP might suggest...".</p>
      <h4>your GP</h4>
      <p>We use "your GP" when the user is likely to be under a GP's ongoing care, for example, for a condition like diabetes or in the context of follow-up care.</p>
      <p>We also use "your GP" rather than "a GP" in a transactional journey, such as NHS 111 online, where we have information about the user and we are referring them to their GP during office hours.</p>
      <h3 id="GP-online-services">GP online services</h3>
      <p>We use "GP online services" as the collective term for online services like appointment booking, repeat prescription orders and medical record access.</p>
      <p>Or you can use "GP surgery's online services" if this is clearer for your users.</p>
      <p>See also <a href="#GP-system-supplier-names-and-patient-facing-services">GP system supplier names and patient-facing services</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="GP-surgery">GP surgery</h3>
      <p>When we're writing for the public, we use "GP surgery" or "surgery" rather than "practice", because our research shows us that this is the word patients are more likely to search for and use.</p>
      <p>When we're writing for healthcare staff, we may use the term "GP practice" or "practice" for short. For example, for "practice managers".</p>
      <p>Note that a GP practice can have more than 1 surgery.</p>
      <h3 id="GP-system-supplier-names-and-patient-facing-services">GP system supplier names and patient-facing services</h3>
      <p>Users often do not recognise the name of GP systems in isolation from their patient-facing services.</p>
      <p>Usability testing by the NHS App team showed that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>users recognise "Patient Access" but often do not recognise the name of the supplier "EMIS"</li>
        <li>they recognise "SystmOnline" but often do not recognise the name of the supplier "TPP"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For patients, when referring to the GP system we say:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>EMIS (Patient Access)</li>
        <li>TPP (SystmOnline)</li>
        <li>Vision (Patient Services)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For patients, when referring to the patient-facing service of a GP system, it's OK not to include the supplier name. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Patient Access</li>
        <li>SystmOnline</li>
        <li>Patient Services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For healthcare staff, it's OK to refer to the system name of the GP supplier if appropriate. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>EMIS or EMIS Web</li>
        <li>TPP or TPP SystmOne</li>
        <li>Vision or Vision 3</li>

      <p>We use "health record" rather than "medical record". "Health record" is more accurate as someone's record may cover social care as well as medical content. In our user research, we haven’t seen anyone confused by "health record". People see it as the same as a "medical record".</p>
      <p>In some contexts, for example in forms, rather than asking about someone's "health record", we ask about "your health, and any health problems or treatments you've had in the past".</p>

      <p>We only use the microgram symbol (μg) if people will find it helpful, for example, if they will see it on their medicines or vitamins packet. In cases like these, we add the following when we first mention micrograms: "The word microgram is sometimes written with the Greek symbol μ followed by the letter g (μg)." We explain that it's a Greek symbol so that people who use screen readers understand it when they hear an unexpected sound.</p>
      <p>We do not use μg as an abbreviation in text that follows.</p>
      <h3 id="milk">milk</h3>
      <p>In "cows' milk" and "goats' milk", the apostrophe comes after the "s".</p>
      <p>In "sheep's milk", the apostrophe comes before the "s", because "sheep" is plural.</p>
      <p>We write "breast milk" as two words.</p>
      <h3 id="morning-after-pill">morning after pill</h3>
      <p>Lower case without hyphens. It can be "emergency contraception".</p>
      <h3 id="MRI-scan">MRI scan</h3>
      <p>The abbreviation is fine.</p>
      <h3 id="mucus-and-mucous">mucus and mucous</h3>

      <h3 id="NHS">NHS</h3>
      <p>We do not usually spell out "National Health Service". It's fine to use the abbreviation.</p>
      <p>We refer to it as "the NHS", unless we're using NHS as an adjective, for example "NHS services".</p>
      <h3 id="NHS-111-online">NHS 111 online</h3>
      <p>On the NHS website and in national digital services, say "Go to <a href="https://111.nhs.uk">111.nhs.uk</a> or call 111" if it's a call to action.</p>
      <p>In content that explains the service, for example policy or programme content, use "NHS 111 online". Include the word NHS and give online a small "o".</p>

      <p>With an upper case A. It's the name of a specific app.</p>
      <p>To avoid repetition of "NHS App", you can use "the app" where needed, for example "You can also order repeat prescriptions in the app".</p>
      <p>When referring to something inside the NHS App, use "in" the app, not "on" or "with" the app. For example, "You can get health advice in the NHS App".</p>
      <p>When advising users about the browser version of the NHS App, we say: "You can also access NHS App services from the browser on your desktop or laptop computer".</p>

      <p>The full name of the organisation is NHS England and NHS Improvement. The abbreviation is NHSEI.</p>
      <h3 id="NHS-login">NHS login</h3>
      <p>We write "login" in lower case and as one word. <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/nhs-login/">The NHS login</a> lets people see their personal health information online.</p>
      <h3 id="NHS-number">NHS number</h3>
      <p>Write the NHS number as 3 groups of numbers, with a single space between them, like this: 485 777 3456. (This is an example or test number.)</p>
      <p>The format is 3 3 4: 2 groups of 3 digits followed by 4 digits.</p>
      <p>Make sure that you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>use this format whenever you include an example or include an NHS number</li>
        <li>keep the NHS number on 1 line - do not allow it to break over 2 lines</li>
        <li>only use a space as a separator - do not use dashes or dots</li>
        <li>do not use a real NHS number as an example - use 485 777 3456 or 123 456 7890</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This number format makes it easier for people and assistive technologies to read. It also makes it less likely that people will make mistakes.</p>
      <p>Ask your frontend or coding colleagues how to stop the NHS number breaking over 2 lines.</p>

      <h3 id="nhs.uk-and-NHS.UK">nhs.uk and NHS.UK</h3>
      <p>When we're referring to the website at <a href="https://www.nhs.uk">nhs.uk</a>, we call it "the NHS website". We give the url in lower case.</p>
      <p>If we're talking about NHS.UK as a programme in NHS Digital, we use capital letters.</p>
      <h3 id="NHSX">NHSX</h3>
      <p>We no longer use NHSX. It is now part of the Transformation Directorate at NHS England.</p>
      <h3 id="normally">normally</h3>

      <p>We use the word "mouth". For example, we say "mouth cancer" rather than "oral cancer".</p>
      <p>If we're talking about taking medicines, we say "by mouth" or "that you swallow".</p>
      <h3 id="oral-contraceptives">oral contraceptives</h3>
      <p>We use "contraceptive pills".</p>
      <h3 id="organisations">organisations</h3>
      <p>We use a singular verb for an organisation. For example: "The NHS in England deals with over 1 million patients every 36 hours." Or "The World Health Organization says …".</p>
      <p>We use the pronoun "it" for the NHS.</p>
      <p>Organisations do not do things. The people in organisations do. So we say: "Tell hospital staff in advance if you can’t attend your appointment and they will try to arrange a new one", rather than "… the hospital will arrange a new one".</p>
      <h3 id="outpatient">outpatient</h3>
      <p>One word. Like inpatient.</p>
      <h3 id="over-the-counter-or-OTC">over the counter or OTC</h3>

      <p>We use the nouns "pee" and "urine". We know that everyone can understand "pee", including people who find reading difficult. Most people also understand and search for "urine", for example in phrases like "blood in urine". </p>
      <p>We do not use "wee" because it can confuse people who use voice technologies or screen readers.</p>
      <p>We use "pee" for the verb, not "urinate" or "pass urine". We know that the people who use NHS digital services talk about and search for "peeing more often" and "peeing at night".</p>
      <h3 id="people-or-patients">people or patients</h3>
      <p>Generally, we address people as "you".</p>
      <p>If we're writing in the third person, we mostly use "people" but this varies depending on the context. "People" is a broad term which covers patients, carers, their family and friends.</p>
      <p>We prefer "people" for content aimed at the general public but we sometimes use "patients" if the word "people" might be confusing, for example, where we need to distinguish patients from the general public.</p>
      <p>"Patients" may also be more suitable in content for health professionals.</p>

      <h3 id="personal-child-health-record-(red-book)">personal child health record (red book)</h3>
      <p>All lower case. We include the phrase "red book" in brackets the first time we mention "personal child health record". Then we usually call it the "red book" after the first mention.</p>
      <p>Also see <a href="#health-record">health record</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="pharmacy">pharmacy</h3>
      <p>We use "pharmacy", not "chemist". Our users are more likely to look for the word "pharmacy".</p>
      <h3 id="phone-and-phone-numbers">phone and phone numbers</h3>
      <p>We use "phone" rather than "telephone" for mobile and landline phones. Use phone: 011 111 111 or mobile:. Do not use mob:.</p>
      <p>Use spaces between city and local exchange. Here are the different formats to use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>01273 800 900</li>
        <li>020 7450 4000</li>

        <li>+39 1 33 45 70 90</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When an organisation has chosen a memorable number, for example for a campaign, group the numbers into easily remembered units. An example is the number for the Samaritans: 116 123.</p>
      <p>We prefer to use "call" or "phone", not "ring" or "dial". Survey responses show that users are more likely to use "call" or "phone".</p>
      <h3 id="PMS-(premenstrual-syndrome)">PMS (premenstrual syndrome)</h3>
      <p>We prefer "PMS" instead of "premenstrual syndrome". PMS is a commonly understood term and it is used more often than "premenstrual syndrome". But we should write it as "PMS (premenstrual syndrome)" at the first mention to make it clear what PMS stands for.</p>
      <p>We do not say "premenstrual tension" or "PMT" as these terms are more dated and users do not search for these as much as PMS.</p>
      <h3 id="poo">poo</h3>
      <p>We mostly use "poo", rather than "stool". We know that everyone can understand "poo", including people who find reading difficult.</p>
      <p>We do not use "opening your bowels" or "bowel movements".</p>
      <p>We sometimes use the words "stool" or "bowel" when people will hear their GP use them. But we will explain the term or phrase.  For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"a sample of poo (stool sample)"</li>
        <li>"Bowel incontinence can affect people in different ways. You may have a problem if you have sudden urges to poo that you can't control."</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="positive">positive</h3>
      <p>If you use the word "positive" in the context of test results, be aware that some users may interpret it as positive news. In other words, they may think they do not have the disease or condition.</p>
      <p>If you have to use "positive", because this is the word people will hear when they get their test results, explain what it means.</p>
      <p>Example: "A positive result means it's likely you had coronavirus (COVID-19) when the test was done."</p>
      <h3 id="practice">practice</h3>
      <p>"Practice" is the noun, as in "GP practice". "Practise" is a verb. For example: "Practise pelvic floor exercises".</p>
      <p>When we're writing for the public, we use "surgery" rather than "practice", because our research shows us that this is the word patients are more likely to search for and use.</p>
      <p>When we're writing for healthcare staff, we may use the word "practice". For example, for "practice managers".</p>
      <p>Note that a GP practice can have more than 1 surgery.</p>
      <h3 id="pre-school">pre-school</h3>
      <p>With a hyphen.</p>
      <h3 id="preconception-care">preconception care</h3>
      <p>We prefer "planning your pregnancy" or "thinking about your health before you get pregnant" or just "getting pregnant". This is the kind of language our users use.</p>
      <p>Clinicians sometimes use "preconception care" when they're talking about women who need special care before they get pregnant - for example, changes to their medicine. We do not use "preconception care" as a topic. Instead we give specific advice where people need it, for example: "Talk to your doctor if you want to get pregnant. It's best to stop taking [name of medicine] at least 3 months before you start trying for a baby."</p>

      <p>When you mention redness in content, always consider whether the description is accurate for all skin tones. A symptom that looks red when it appears on white skin may not look red on skin that's brown or black.</p>

      <p>We add the word "fit" after "seizure" ("seizure or fit") in content about epilepsy, brain cancer and brain tumours. We know that "seizure" is the word that people with epilepsy use, understand and generally prefer and that it's not the same as a "fit" (which is a kind of seizure that makes the body jerk and shake uncontrollably). But some of our users do not understand the word "seizure" and including the word "fit" when we first mention seizures helps them.</p>
      <p>In general content, for example, with medicines that might make people jerk and shake uncontrollably as a side effect, we use the term "seizure or fit" and explain that this is what we mean.</p>
      <h3 id="service-user">service user</h3>
      <p>We prefer "<a href="#people-or-patients">people" or "patients</a>" - or in social services "people who use services".</p>

      <h3 id="sex-assigned-or-registered-at-birth">sex assigned or registered at birth</h3>
      <p>We use the phrase "sex assigned at birth" when we're talking about trans health and gender dysphoria, as this is the language our audience uses. In other cases, we use "the sex someone was registered with at birth" because user research shows that most people understand this better as it refers to an actual event.</p>
      <h3 id="sexual-health-clinic">sexual health clinic</h3>
      <p>We use "sexual health clinic", not "STI clinic".</p>
      <p>Sexual health clinics can offer different services. So, when we mention them for the first time and are talking about STIs, we sometimes add that they may also be called "GUM clinics".</p>
      <p>When we are talking about contraception, we sometimes add that they may also be called "family planning or contraception clinics".</p>
      <p>Also see "<a href="#STI">STI</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="sick">sick</h3>
      <p>We use "feeling sick" instead of "nausea", but you may want to put "nausea" in brackets afterwards: feeling sick (nausea).</p>
      <p>We use "being sick" instead of "vomiting". Again, you may want to put "vomiting" in brackets afterwards: being sick (vomiting).</p>
      <p>We use "vomiting" in phrases like "vomiting blood".</p>
      <p>We use "vomit" as the noun. For example, "blood in your vomit".</p>
      <h3 id="side-effects">side effects</h3>
      <p>Two words.</p>
      <p>We say that people may "get" or "have" side effects, not "develop" or "experience" them.</p>
      <p>Check a dictionary if you're not sure of the difference between "affect" and "effect".</p>
      <h3 id="site-map">site map</h3>
      <p>We write "site map" as 2 words so that screen readers pronounce it clearly.</p>
      <h3 id="sleepy">sleepy</h3>
      <p>Generally, we prefer the word "sleepy" to "drowsy" as people are more likely to search for "sleepy". But "<a href="#drowsy">drowsy</a>" may be better if you're writing about feeling unusually sleepy in the daytime, particularly in the context of medicines.</p>
      <h3 id="skin-colour-changes">skin colour changes</h3>
      <p>When you mention a change in skin colour, such as a red rash, redness with swelling, or skin turning yellow or blue, always consider whether the change will look the same on all skin tones.</p>

      <h3 id="STI">STI</h3>
      <p>You might want to spell out "sexually transmitted infection" the first time you mention it. Otherwise it’s fine to use the abbreviation STI.</p>
      <p>We talk about "a" sexually transmitted infection but "an" STI.</p>
      <p>We do not use the terms "sexually transmitted disease" or "STD".</p>
      <p>Also see "<a href="#sexual-health-clinic">sexual health clinic</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="stomach">stomach</h3>
      <p>We use "stomach" for the internal organ and in some common phrases like "stomach ache" and "stomach bug".</p>
      <p>We sometimes use "<a href="#tummy">tummy</a>" for short, for example in "tummy bug".</p>
      <p>Also see "<a href="#abdomen-and-abdominal">abdomen</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="stool">stool</h3>
      <p>See <a href="#poo">poo</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="suffering-from">suffering from</h3>
      <p>We do not use "suffering from". We talk about people having or living with a disability or condition.</p>
      <p>Read more about how we talk about <a href="/content/inclusive-content/disabilities-and-conditions">disabilities and conditions in the Inclusive content section</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="summary-care-record">summary care record</h3>
      <p>Lower case.</p>
      <p>For a professional audience (people who will know the abbreviation already), it's OK to use SCR after the first mention of a summary care record. (It's "an", not "a", SCR.)</p>
      <p>For the public, we avoid the abbreviation. Instead it may be better to say: "your <a href="#health-record">health record</a>" or "a summary of your health record".</p>
      <h3 id="surgery">surgery</h3>
      <p>When we're writing for the public, we use "GP surgery" or "surgery" rather than "practice", because our research shows us that this is the word patients are more likely to search for and use.</p>
      <p>When we're writing for healthcare staff, we may use the word "practice". For example, for "practice managers".</p>
      <p>Note that a practice can have more than 1 surgery.</p>
      <h3 id="symptoms">symptoms</h3>
      <p>We say that people may "get" or "have" symptoms, not "develop" or "experience" them.</p>

      <p>See "<a href="#phone-and-phone-numbers">phone and phone numbers</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="temperature">temperature</h3>
      <p>We avoid giving a specific temperature in most cases. This is because it's normal for people's temperature to rise when they are ill or have an infection. How much their temperature changes varies from person to person. So we do not focus on a particular temperature.</p>
      <p>In a list of symptoms, we say "a high temperature" or "if your child is feeling hotter than usual if you touch their neck, back or tummy".</p>
      <p>When we're telling people to do something about a high temperature in an adult or a child over 6 months old (for example, in the pattern to <a href="/design-system/patterns/help-users-decide-when-and-where-to-get-care">help users decide when and where to get care, with care cards</a>), we say:</p>
      <ul><li>"if your temperature is very high, or you feel hot or shivery"</li>
          <li>"if your child's temperature is very high, or they feel hot or shivery"</li></ul>
      <p>The exception is when talking about the temperature of a child under 6 months old. In these cases we state a specific temperature and say:</p>
      <ul><li>"if your child is under 3 months old and has a temperature of 38C or higher, or you think they have a high temperature"</li>
      <li>"if your child is 3 to 6 months old and has a temperature of 39C or higher, or you think they have a high temperature"</li></ul>
      <p>Also see "<a href="#degrees-(temperature)">degrees (temperature)</a>" and "<a href="#fever">fever</a>".</p>
      <h3 id="terminal">terminal</h3>
      <p>We use "terminal" when a condition or illness is likely to lead to death. We find that people with cancer, for example, often use this word.</p>
      <h3 id="time">time</h3>
      <p>See our guidance on <a href="/content/numbers-measurements-dates-time#time">time on the Numbers, measurements, dates and time page</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="tranquillise-and-tranquilliser">tranquillise and tranquilliser</h3>
      <p>Note the double "ll". We use the British spelling with "s", not "z".</p>
      <h3 id="trimesters">trimesters</h3>
      <p>We mostly use "weeks" when writing about time in pregnancy.</p>
      <p>We've found that most users think about their pregnancy in "weeks" or "months", but using "weeks" means we can be more precise.</p>
      <p>Trimesters are less clear. If you do use the word "trimester", explain what you mean, for example: "the 1st trimester (up to about 13 weeks)".
      <p>We use numerals for <a href="/content/numbers-measurements-dates-time#numbers">numbers</a>, for example "13 weeks", instead of "thirteen weeks".</p>
      <h3 id="try-to">try to</h3>
      <p>We prefer "try to" to "try and".</p>
      <h3 id="tummy">tummy</h3>
      <p>Some users feel that "tummy" is childish but it can work well in content about children.</p>
      <p>It can also be a good alternative to abdomen when you're talking about the outside of the body (a broader area than the stomach).</p>
      <p>Also see "<a href="#abdomen-and-abdominal">abdomen</a>" and "<a href="#stomach">stomach</a>".</p>

      <h3 id="vaccination">vaccination</h3>
      <p>We use "vaccination" for the process or national programme. (We do not say "immunisation programme".)</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>NHS vaccination schedule</li>
        <li>flu vaccination programme</li>
        <li>coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination programme</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most people search for "vaccination", not "immunisation".</p>
      <p>"Vaccination" includes injections and oral or nasal spray.</p>
      <h3 id="vaccine">vaccine</h3>
      <p>We use "vaccine" for the dose people get as part of a vaccination programme.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the 6‑in‑1 vaccine</li>
        <li>the HPV vaccine</li>
        <li>you will have the vaccine as an injection in (part of the body)</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Use "coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine" on the first mention, then use "COVID-19 vaccine".</p>
    <p>Use "coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination" for the vaccination process or programme, then "COVID-19 vaccination".</p>
    <p>Example: someone will get the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine as part of the COVID-19 vaccination programme.</p>
    <p>For the annual flu vaccination programme, use the term "flu vaccine". The child vaccine is a spray, so "flu vaccine" covers children and adults.</p>
    <p>See also the entries for <a href="#booster">booster</a> and <a href="#jab">jab</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="vial">vial</h3>
      <p>We prefer plain English terms like "plastic tube" or "glass container". If people need to know the word "vial", we might add it in brackets, for example: "plastic tube (vial)".</p>
      <h3 id="vomiting">vomiting</h3>
      <p>We use "being sick" instead of "vomiting". You may want to put "vomiting" in brackets afterwards: being sick (vomiting).</p>
      <p>We use "vomiting" in phrases like "vomiting blood".</p>
      <p>We use "vomit" as the noun. For example, "blood in your vomit".</p>

      <p>Use lower-case when you're writing about skin colour.</p>
      <h3 id="white-skin">white skin</h3>
      <p>We talk about skin colour clearly and use terms that are easy to understand, including "white skin". We do not describe white skin as "fair" or "light".</p>

      <h3 id="wind">wind</h3>
      <p>We use "wind" when we're talking about babies. For example, "bringing up wind".</p>
