  <h2 id="abbreviations-and-acronyms">Abbreviations and acronyms</h2>
  <p>We explain an abbreviation or acronym in full on its first use unless it's well known, like UK, NHS, GP. Then we refer to it by initials.</p>
  <p>Example: A body mass index (BMI) above the healthy weight range can increase your risk of serious health problems.</p>

  <h2 id="aligning-text">Aligning text</h2>
  <p>Left-align text in English.</p>
  <p>Some people with cognitive differences have difficulty with blocks of text that are justified (aligned to left and right margins).</p>
  <p>Also people who use screen magnifiers may miss text that is not left-aligned.</p>
  <p>For translations into languages that run right to left (like Arabic), right-align instead.</p>
  <p>Read about <a href="/design-system/styles/typography#text-alignment">text alignment in the design system</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="apostrophes">Apostrophes</h2>
  <p>We use straight, not curly apostrophes. Take care when pasting in text.</p>
  {{ table({
    panel: false,
    firstCellIsHeader: false,
    head: [
      {
        text: "Do not use"
      },
      {
        text: "Use"
      }
    ],
    rows: [
      [
        {
          text: "you’ll"
        },
        {
          text: "you'll"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }) }}

  <p>Read more about contractions like "you'll" and "can't" in the <a href="/content/formatting-and-punctuation#contractions"> contractions section</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="bold">Bold</h2>
  <p>Use bold in technical instructions to tell users which element (for example, a text input or button) to select. For example: Select <strong>More</strong>, then select <strong>Messages</strong>.</p>
  <p>Use bold sparingly – too much bold makes it difficult for users to know which parts of your content they need to pay most attention to.</p>
  <p>Do not use bold to emphasise text. To emphasise words or phrases, you can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>front-load sentences</li>
    <li>use headings</li>
    <li>use bullets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="capitalisation">Capitalisation</h2>
  <p>We do not use block capitals as they're difficult for people to read.</p>
  <p>We always use sentence case, including page titles. The exception is proper nouns and examples in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style">GOV.UK style guide capitalisation list.</a></p>
  <p>Generic drug names start lower case. Brand names get an initial capital letter, except where the brand uses lower case itself.</p>

  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Codeine comes mixed with paracetamol (co-codamol) or with aspirin (co-codaprin) or with ibuprofen (Nurofen Plus).</li>
    <li>Watch these <a href="https://www.healthtalk.org/">healthtalk.org</a> videos.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Conditions are lower case except where they start with a proper name.</p>

  <p>Examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Alzheimer's disease</li>
    <li>cancer of the colon</li>
    <li>Down's syndrome</li>
    <li>multiple sclerosis</li>
    <li>Parkinson's disease</li>
    <li>type 1 diabetes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>But note: caesarean section.</p>

  <p>Also see the entries for "<a href="/content/a-to-z-of-nhs-health-writing#Black-or-black">Black or black</a>" and "<a href="/content/a-to-z-of-nhs-health-writing#White-or-white">White or white</a>" in the A to Z of NHS health writing.</p>

  <h2 id="contractions">Contractions</h2>
  <p>We use contractions like you'll, we'll, you're and what's. Often contractions make content friendlier and easier to read.</p>
  <p>Do not use negative contractions like can't and don't. When you’re telling users not to do something, use "Do not" rather than "Don't".</p>
  <p>Avoid should've, could've, would've and they've. They can be hard to read.</p>

  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text nhsuk-u-margin-top-4">
    <h3>Research insight</h3>
    <p>GDS research shows that many users find negative contractions harder to read and they sometimes misread them as the opposite of what they say.</p>
    <p>The NHS.UK medicines team observed that, when we're telling people not to do something, they find "do not" clearer and more emphatic than "don't".</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Contractions in URLs and page titles</h3>
  <p>Do not use contractions in URLs (web addresses). They can be unclear, hard to read, type and share. Some are ambiguous, like "shell" and "were" (for "she'll" and "we're"). </p>
  <p>If you can, avoid using contractions in page titles and H1s too. Ideally the page title and URL should be the same.</p>

  <h2 id="full-stops">Full stops</h2>
  <p>Do not use full stops in headings, <a href="/design-system/components/buttons">buttons</a> or <a href="/design-system/components/action-link">action links</a>.</p>

  <p>We do not use full stops in <a href="/design-system/components/card">cards</a>, where the card contains a single sentence and acts as a brief link to another page.</p>

  <h2 id="hyphens-and-dashes">Hyphens and dashes</h2>
  <h3>Hyphens</h3>
  <p>Hyphens can clutter content and make it more difficult to read.</p>
  <p>Only use a hyphen if a word or sentence is confusing without it.</p>
  <p>Ask yourself if there's a chance someone could misread what you've written and then add a hyphen if needed. Compare "recover" and "re-cover" (meaning "put on a new cover").</p>
  <p>You can often write something simply and clearly without a hyphen. For example, "has no sugar" instead of "sugar-free".</p>
  <p>We use a hyphen for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>non-alcoholic</li>
    <li>non-drowsy</li>
    <li>self-care, self-help, self-isolate, self-test</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use a hyphen for:
  <ul>
    <li>anticoagulant</li>
    <li>beta blockers</li>
    <li>breastfeeding</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Whether or not we use a hyphen depends on the context.</p>
  <p>Use "long term" in phrases like "in the long term". But use a hyphen for "long-term" as an adjective, for example in "long-term care".  Do the same with "short term" and "short-term".</p>
  <p>Use "follow up" as a verb, but "follow-up" with a hyphen in "follow-up appointment".</p>
  <h3>Dashes</h3>
  <p>Avoid using dashes to indicate a pause. Instead use a comma, or write shorter sentences.</p>
  <p>We use "to" instead of a dash for <a href="/content/numbers-measurements-dates-time#ranges">ranges of numbers, dates or time</a>.</p>

  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text nhsuk-u-margin-top-4">
    <h4 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Research insight</h4>
    <p>There are some accessibility concerns with dashes. Assistive technologies read them out in different ways. But <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/12/18/what-working-on-gov-uk-navigation-taught-us-about-accessibility/">GOV.UK research</a> shows that commas are consistently read out with a pause.</p>
    <p>People with poor literacy can find hyphens and dashes an obstacle to easy reading. They also find long sentences with lots of commas difficult.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
  <p>Use lists to make text easier to read.​</p>
  <p>Bulleted lists should be short and snappy. If possible, limit your list to no more than 6 items.​ Each item in the list should be roughly the same length.</p>
  <p>We use bullet points in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the pattern to <a href="/design-system/patterns/help-users-decide-when-and-where-to-get-care">help users decide when and where to get care (care cards)</a></li>
    <li><a href="/design-system/components/do-and-dont-lists">Do and Don’t lists</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Lists with a lead-in line</h3>
  <p>This is our preferred list style.</p>
  <p>Use a lead-in line with a colon. The bullets should make sense running on from the lead-in line. In effect, the list is 1 continuous sentence.</p>

  <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <p>A pharmacist can recommend:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>creams to ease pain and irritation</li>
      <li>antiviral creams to speed up healing time</li>
      <li>cold sore patches to protect the skin while it heals</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>Each bullet point starts lower case and has no punctuation at the end, including after the last point.</p>
  <p>Do not include more than 1 sentence at each bullet point.</p>
  <p>Avoid ending a bullet point with "and" and "or". Use the lead-in to let people know the options.</p>

  <h3>Full sentence lists</h3>
  <p>If your user research shows that it helps your users, you can use full sentence bullet points. For example, our medicines information uses full sentence bullet points for key facts.</p>

  <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <h3>Key facts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Paracetamol takes up to an hour to work.</li>
      <li>The usual dose of paracetamol is one or two 500mg tablets at a time.</li>
      <li>Do not take paracetamol with other medicines containing paracetamol.</li>
      <li>Paracetamol is safe to take in pregnancy and while breastfeeding, at recommended doses.</li>
      <li>Brand names include Disprol, Hedex, Medinol and Panadol.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>Each bullet point should be distinct information, start with a capital letter and end with a full stop. There should be no lead in line.</p>

  <h3>Numbered lists</h3>
  <p>We use numbered lists instead of bulleted ones to guide people through a process. Each point starts with a capital letter and ends with a full stop, without a lead-in line.</p>

  <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
    <h3>How to gargle with salt water</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Dissolve half a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water.</li>
      <li>Gargle with the solution then spit it out – do not swallow it.</li>
      <li>Repeat as often as you like.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h2 id="quotation-marks">Quotation marks</h2>
  <p>Do not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>overdo quotation marks – they can be distracting and are often unnecessary</li>
    <li>use them to tell users which element (for example, a text input or button) to select – instead use <a href="#bold">bold</a> in technical instructions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We generally use straight double quotes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>when quoting another source</li>
    <li>for unusual or colloquial terms, for example: Diuretics are sometimes called "water pills" because they make you pee more.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use single quotes for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>quotes within quotes, for example: "'Helicopter parenting' linked to behavioural problems in children," reports The Independent.</li>
    <li>headlines</li>
    <li>captions</li>
    <li>large-type quotes</li>
  </ul>
