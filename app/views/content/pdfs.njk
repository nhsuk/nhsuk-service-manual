  <h2>The problem with PDFs</h2>
  <p>We avoid PDFs because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>they cannot meet the range of users' accessibility needs, for example, users cannot change colours or font size</li>
    <li>they give people a poor user experience, especially on mobile</li>
    <li>many browsers, tools and extensions do not work with them - they often have problems with zoom, scroll, audio, image and keyboard navigation</li>
    <li>they take users away from the website, opening in a new tab, window or software - and not all users have the right software</li>
    <li>they are hard to maintain and update, so users may get out of date and unreliable content</li>
    <li>if users find PDFs in search results, they get them without any supporting context or material</li>
    <li>search engines do not rank PDFs high in search results</li>
    <li>it's difficult to collect data on how people use PDFs, and that makes it difficult to identify problems and improve them</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Publishing PDFs with an HTML version</h2>
  <p>In a few cases, where there is a clear, evidenced user need for it, we publish a PDF. But, as far as possible, we also make the same content available as HTML web pages.</p>
  <p>The instances where we may publish a PDF (as well as a web page) are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>for niche audiences, where there is a clear user need for special formats (like Easy Read or foreign language leaflets designed to be printed out)</li>
    <li>for other downloads designed for printing, such as posters</li>
    <li>downloads of reports or publications designed to be published on paper</li>
    <li>where there's a legal or regulatory requirement to have a formal, signed document</li>
    <li>to preserve a permanent record for the future</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you do create a new PDF, it must meet the PDF/A standard. (Follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/accessible-pdfs">GOV.UK guidance on publishing accessible documents</a>.)</p>

  <h2>Older PDFs</h2>
  <p>Teams should make sure that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>they keep their content up to date</li>
    <li>they replace old PDFs with an HTML page or an accessible PDF, or they delete them</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Linking to PDFs</h2>
  <p>It's better to link to HTML pages containing PDF content rather than to PDFs themselves. This makes it easier for users to find the latest information.</p>
