<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Send relevant messages to specific groups of people</h2> 
<p class="nhsuk-body">Research shows that patients' engagement falls if they receive too many messages that are not relevant to them.</p>

<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Identify specific groups and tailor your message content</h2> 
<p class="nhsuk-body">Use your clinical system to identify groups of patients that are as specific as possible.</p>
<p class="nhsuk-body">Then make the message content as relevant as possible to those specific groups. Use all the information you have available.</p>
<h4 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Example</h4>
<div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
  <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Example: </span>
  <p class="nhsuk-body">A group of patients have missed their most recent screening appointment. They have attended previous screening appointments.</p>
<p class="nhsuk-body">You can send a message reminding them of the importance of regular screening.</p> 
</div>

<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Consider different channels to reach wider groups</h3>  
<p class="nhsuk-body">Sending a message to a very large group of patients can mean it's not relevant to everyone who receives it. It can also be very expensive.</p>
<p class="nhsuk-body">Consider whether you can share general information in other ways. For example, putting a banner on your website or a post on social media.</p>

<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Confidential content</h2>
<p class="nhsuk-body">Be cautious about what personal information you include in messages. Other people could see the messages, which could put the patient at risk. For example, many families will share a single mobile phone.</p>
<p class="nhsuk-body">Some people also regularly change their mobile number. It is important to confirm patients' contact details at every opportunity.</p>
<p class="nhsuk-body">Include enough information for the patient to understand what the message means and any action they need to take. But do not include any specific details of their care.</p>
