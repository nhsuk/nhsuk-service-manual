<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Quality and relevance of messages</h2> 
<p class="nhsuk-body">People may not trust a message with spelling and grammatical errors or inaccuracies. They may not think it is genuine.</p> 
<p>To avoid this, you should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>write message content that follows the <a href="/content/voice-and-tone">Voice and tone section of our content guide</a>, so all NHS messages have a consistent style</li>
  <li>follow the <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/business-communications-sms-and-telephone-best-practice">National Cyber Security Centre text message and telephone best practice</a> to help people trust your text messages</li>  
  <li>always ask someone else to check your messages for errors before you send them</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Links</h2> 

<p class="nhsuk-body">Do not use a third-party link shortening service to reduce the length of links, because:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>your users cannot see where the link will take them</li>
  <li>your link might stop working if there's a service outage</li>
  <li>you can no longer control where the redirect goes</li>
</ul>  
<div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
  <h3>Research insight</h3>
  <p class="nhsuk-body">Research has shown that people can be worried about being scammed if a link does not go to an NHS website.</p>

<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Sender names on text messages</h2>
<p class="nhsuk-body">A SenderID is the words that appear on a text message in place of the sending telephone number.</p>
<p class="nhsuk-body">Using an appropriate SenderID can help build trust with message recipients. </p>
<p class="nhsuk-body">You should use <a href="https://mobileecosystemforum.com/sms-senderid-protection-registry/">MEF-registered (official) SenderIDs.</a></p>

<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Protecting people from spam or phishing</h2> 
<p class="nhsuk-body">To protect people from spam or phishing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>avoid making requests for personal information, like a patient's date of birth, in the content of your messages</li>
  <li>only send links to trusted websites, like <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">www.nhs.uk</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">www.gov.uk</a></li>
  <li>spell out any web addresses (URLs) in full, so people know where links are going</li>
  <li>avoid using redirects, like tracking links</li>
  <li>include first names and surnames in the body of emails</li>
</ul>
