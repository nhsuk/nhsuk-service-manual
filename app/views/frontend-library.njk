    <h2>What is a frontend library?</h2>
    <p>We've made our production code available to NHS developers and designers in a "frontend library". The code in the library will help you build accessible websites with an NHS look and feel. You'll also get tested components and patterns.</p>
    <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend">frontend library</a> is in GitHub. You need to sign up to GitHub to use it.</p>

    <h2>Get in touch</h2>
    <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/tree/master/docs/contributing">contribute</a> code via GitHub.</p>
    <p>And you can contact us on the <a href="https://nhsuk.slack.com/messages/standards">NHSUK #standards Slack channel</a> or email the standards team at service-manual@nhs.net.</p>
