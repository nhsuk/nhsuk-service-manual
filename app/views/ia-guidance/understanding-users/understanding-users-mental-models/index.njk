  <h2>How to understand your users' mental models/h2>
  <p>When looking at meeting your users' needs, there needs to be a good understanding of how your users think about your topic.</p>
  <p>You should find out:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What words do they use and understand when describing the topic?</li> 
    <li>How do they group and label the content within your topic?</li>
    <li>What are their Top Tasks for the topic? What are the most important things that they need to accomplish with your content?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are a range of generative research techniques your user researcher may employ to elicit IA user needs, including user interviews, open card sorts, tree tests, prioritisation research and search logs</p>
  <p>Producing visual representations of research findings can really help embed those findings in the team’s collective consciousness. Consider visualising card sort clusters, common vocabularies, behaviour patterns or user priorities.</p>
  <p>Designing sitemaps and navigation structures to match users’ mental models is vital to designing successful IAs.</p>
