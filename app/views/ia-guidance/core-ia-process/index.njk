<h2>Background to the IA process</h2>
<p>When improving the information architecture of topics within a large website that holds a plethora of related information (e.g. NHS.UK is a website about healthcare information), it is important to transform each element in a consistent way.</p>
<p>NHS.UK has a dedicated information architecture team who have applied their learnings to create a set of instructions to help other transform their IA.</p>
<p>Therefore, this guidance should be followed while being mindful that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it is based on the IA of a large website with a large target audience</li>
  <li>it will be a reflection of the work being done on NHS.UK</li>
  <li>the guidance should be used by external users as a guideline of good practice, with the understanding that not all of our principles and processes will be applicable.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Stages of the core IA process</h2>
<p>IMAGE</p>
<p>There are four key stages to the core IA process. They are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>understanding</li>
  <li>ideation</li>
  <li>application</li>
  <li>live</li>
</ol>
<p>These stages will help teams to start a new IA transformation, and support them all the way through to monitoring the impact of the improvements once live.</p>
