  <h2>Update (February 2022)</h2>
  <p>The service manual team is running a reduced service until early April 2022, so that we can support other services and while we form plans for 2022 with our stakeholders across the NHS.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, we're open to contributions from the community as usual.</p>
