    When to use this pattern
    </h2>
    <p>A to Z lists help users find the page they want by bringing together links to lots of pages about 1 broad subjectâ€‹. But they only work when users know the name of the thing they're looking for and they expect to find it under that subject.</p>
    <p>We've found that some users would rather go to an A to Z list of pages than search. For example, when they weren't sure how to spell a word like "appendicitis", they expected to find it in the A-Z.</p>

    <p>The NHS website (nhs.uk) currently uses A to Z lists for:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/">health conditions</a></li>
	    <li><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/">medicines</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When not to use this pattern</h2>
    <p>Do not use the A to Z pattern:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>to group pages about different subjects</li>
	    <li>in a transactional service</li>
      <li>in a content page</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Elements of the A to Z pattern</h2>
       <h3>A to Z navigation</h3>

            {{ designExample({
      type: 'a-z-nav'
    }) }}

    <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-4">Use the A to Z navigation at the top of the page.</p>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">A to Z list panel</h3>
        {{ designExample({
      type: 'a-z-list-panel'
    }) }}
    <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-4">Use a <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/contents-list">contents list</a> at the top of the page to allow users to navigate around a small group of related pages (up to 8 pages), for example a group of pages about a specific condition.

    Pagination
    </h3>

    <p>
      Use <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/pagination">pagination</a>  at the bottom of the page to allow users to navigate around a small group of related pages (up to 8 pages), for example a group of pages about a specific condition.

      Research on this pattern
    </h2>

    <p>
    The mini-hub pattern was created to work on NHS.UK conditions pages.
    </p>

    <p>
    While developing the pattern, we ran 3 rounds of research with users, including those with disabilities and people with low digital literacy on Age-related macular degeneration.
    </p>

    <p>
    The pattern was also reviewed by the Digital Accessibility Centre.
    </p>

    <p>
    In testing, the structure and labelling of the pages fitted the mental model of all users, helping them to understand the structure of the content.
    </p>

    <p>
    Users found the active link formatting on the menu helpful in knowing where they are. Some users felt that the links (in the content list) helped them understand what information there is, and choose what is relevant to them.
    </p>

    <p>
    The majority of users we tested with, including a user with very low digital skills - used pagination to navigate through pages and knew this was associated with the contents list at the top of the page.
    </p>
