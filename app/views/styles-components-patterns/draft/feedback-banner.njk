    <h2>When to use the feedback banner</h2>
    <p>Use the feedback banner to ask people to complete a survey or give you feedback in some other way.</p>
    <p>Make sure the feedback banner doesn't appear until the user has agreed to use the appropriate cookies.</p>

    <h2>When not to use the feedback banner</h2>
    <p>Do not use the feedback banner when there is a state of emergency, for example an epidemic, and your page has emergency messages.</p>
    <p>Do not use the banner when your page is telling users to get emergency healthcare, for example in a <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/care-cards#emergency-care-card-red-and-black">immediate care card</a>. </p>
    <p>In both cases, the banner could distract users from more important messages.</p>

    <h2>How to use the  banner</h2>
    <p>The banner appears 5 seconds after a user lands on the page.</p>
    <p>It should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>appear at the end of a user's journey, for example in a transactional service – so you don’t annoy them (too much)</li>
      <li>be prominent – so they notice it</li>
      <li>be easy to close (dismiss)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Include a short, clear heading, like "Help us make the NHS website better" and make sure that the link text to the survey tells users where they are going and why, for example: "Take our short survey".</p>
    <p>Add hidden text to the close button so that people who use screen readers understand what they are closing.</p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>The feedback banner</li>
    <ul>
      <li>exceeds AAA colour contrast guidelines with its text colour</li>
      <li>exceeds AA colour contrast guidelines with its link colour (just short of AAA)</li>
      <li>has a short, clear heading (h2)</li>
      <li>includes link text that describes where the link is taking users and why</li>
      <li>has a close action which is button and not a link</li>
      <li>includes hidden text in the close button to help people who use screen readers understand what they are closing, for example: "Close feedback invite"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>We introduced the feedback banner on the NHS website in April 2018.</p>
    <p>Before this we had a persistent green banner which appeared straight away and stuck to the footer of the browser window. A lot of users said that they were unhappy about being asked for their views before they had read the page.</p>
    <p>Since we changed the colour to white and added a 5 second delay, we've received fewer negative comments and increased feedback on the page. </p>
