<ul>
<li>a <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/typography">heading and sub-heading</a> which sit at the top of the page</li>

    <h2 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">When to use this pattern</h2>
    <p>Use mini-hubs to present information on 1 complex topic spread over 2-8 pages.</p>
    <p>We've found that mini-hubs help users understand complex topics. They break the topic down into manageable chunks and help users digest the information in a way that meets their needs.</p>
    <p>But this isn't the case for all of the NHS website. (We explain more in the <a href=#research>Research section</a> on this page.) Test the pattern with your users to make sure that it works for your content.</p>

    <h2>When not to use this pattern</h2>
    <p>Do not use mini-hubs:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>for pages that are not about a single topic</li>
	    <li>in a transactional service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Elements of the mini-hub</h2>
    <h3>Heading and sub-heading</h3>
    <p>Use an h1 <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/typography#headings">heading</a> at the top of the page. The h1 heading should be the title of the page you're on, not the mini-hub topic.</p>
    <p class="rich-text">Put the mini-hub topic underneath the page heading as a sub-heading. The sub-heading has an <code>h1</code> tag but with the class of <code>class="nhsuk-caption-xl"</code>. (We explain why we do this in the <a href=#research>Research section</a> on this page.)</p>

    <p>In this example, "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)" is the topic. "What is AMD?" is the heading for the page.</p>

        {{ designExample({
      type: 'typography-mini-hub-heading'
    }) }}

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Contents list</h3>
    <p>Use a <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/contents-list">contents list</a> at the top of the page, underneath the heading and sub-heading, to help users navigate around a small group of related pages (up to 8 pages), for example a group of pages about a specific health condition. The example on this page is from the NHS website information about AMD.</p>

        {{ designExample({
      type: 'contents-list'
    }) }}

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">Pagination</h3>
    <p>Use <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/pagination">pagination</a> at the bottom of the page to help users navigate around a small group of related pages (up to 8 pages), for example a group of pages about a specific health condition.</p>

        {{ designExample({
      type: 'pagination'
    }) }}

    <h2 id="research" class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">Research on this pattern</h2>
    <p>We developed the mini-hub pattern for NHS website pages about health conditions.</p>
    <p>We ran 3 rounds of research and tested our information about AMD with a range of users, including people with disabilities and people with low digital literacy. The Digital Accessibility Centre also tested the pattern.</p>
    <p>We found that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the structure and labelling of the pages fitted users' mental model and helped them understand the structure of the content</li>
      <li>the active link formatting in the contents list helped users know where they were and, in some cases, it helped them choose the information that was relevant to them</li>
      <li>most users (including a user with very low digital skills) used the pagination to navigate through pages and knew it was related to the contents list at the top of the page</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Heading structure</h3>
    <p>At first we made the mini-hub topic the main h1 heading but, when users navigated between pages, it wasn't obvious to them which page they were on. In some cases they didn't realise they had moved between pages. It was only when we made the page heading the h1 that users were clear which page they were on.</p>
    <p class="rich-text">We found that screen readers struggled to pronounce the heading and sub-heading together and that confused people. So we've used <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags around the <code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code> to help screen readers read more naturally. We've also included <code>&lt;span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;</code> to add a natural pause.</p>
    <h3>Where this pattern did not work</h3>
    <p>We tried using this pattern for information about <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/">medicines</a> and found that users didn't understand that the separate pages of a mini-hub made up a whole medicines topic. Users expected to see all the information about a medicine on 1 long page.</p>
