    <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/tree/master/packages/components/pagination">get the latest pagination code</a> in the NHS.UK frontend library in GitHub.</p>
    <h2>When to use pagination</h2>
    <p>Use pagination as a method of navigation for small groups (up to 8 pages) of related content, such as a group of pages on a specific condition.</p>
    <p>This component also requires <a href="/service-manual/patterns/contents-list">contents list</a> at the top of the page - both components together become the multi-page navigation pattern.</p>
    <h2>When not to use pagination</h2>
    <p>Do not use the pagination component on non grouped pages or 'related' pages as it will likely confuse the user.</p>
    <p>Do not use pagination in the context of a transactional service or a form as these have their own means of navigation <a href="/service-manual/patterns/buttons">buttons</a> to move forward (progress) and <a href="/patterns/back-link">back link</a> to navigate back.</p>
    <h2>How to use </h2>
    <p>The <a href="/service-manual/patterns/contents-list">contents list</a> at the top of the page must be used in conjunction with the pagination component, used at the bottom of each page.</p>
    <p>Keep links short and descriptive. Links that are too long (more than two lines) inhibit the scannability of this component.</p>
    <p>Page titles must reflect the subject of the specific page (e.g. ‘Treatment’), whilst the overall subject of the section must form the sub-header (e.g. ‘Age-related macular degeneration’). This is so users are clear where they have navigated to.</p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p class="rich-text">The list of links is surrounded by a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element to indicate that they are navigations links. This element has an <code>aria-label</code> attribute with the value <code>Pages in this guide</code>. This will be read out by screen readers that support this attribute to help clarify what the list of links are.</p>
    <p class="rich-text">Additionally there is a visually hidden heading title <code>Contents</code> which will be read by screen readers as a heading to the links.</p>
    <p class="rich-text">If the link describes the current page that you are on, then it has the <code>aria-current="page"</code> value to indicate to screen readers that this is the case.</p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>The pagination component was tested in the context of a condition information guide (grouped pages on same subject) in three labs: 20th June 2018, 4th July 2018 and 16th July 2018.</p>
    <p>This component hasn't been tested on forms or 'related' pages.</p>
    <p>In a user research lab, 4/5 users, including a user with very low digital skills – used pagination to navigate through pages, and knew this was associated with the navigation at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>Users found the pagination particularly useful for navigating based on the way they read content and it supporting their mental model of the guide structure. </p>
