    When to use this pattern
    </h2>
<p>We've found mini-hubs to be a great way to help users understand complex topics. They break complex subjects down into manageable chunks and allow the user to digest the information in a way that meets their needs.</p>
<p>But this isn't the case for all of our pages on <a href="https://www.nhs.uk">NHS.UK</a>. We tested this pattern <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/">medicines information</a> pages and found users not understanding that the separate pages of a mini-hub made up a whole medicines topic.</p>

    <p>
    NHS.UK uses mini-hubs to present topics that:
    </p>

    <ul>
	<li>have a handful of pages on one subject/topic</li>
	<li>are made up for 2-8 pages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
    When not to use this pattern
    </h2>

    <p>
    NHS.UK does not use mini-hub:
    </p>

    <ul>
	<li>on non-related topic pages</li>
	<li>for content inside a transactional service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Elements of the mini-hub</h2>

        <h3>
    Heading and sub-heading
    </h3>

    <p>
  Use a <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/typography">h1 heading</a> at the top of the page. The h1 heading should be for the page your on, not the mini-hub topic.
   </p>
   <p class="rich-text">
   The mini-hub topic sits beneath the page heading as a sub-heading. The sub-heading has a <code>h1</code> tag but with the class of <code>class="nhsuk-caption-xl"</code>
   </p>

    <p>
    We originally tested the mini-hub topic being the main h1 heading but found when users navigated between pages it wasn't obvious what page they were on, and in some cases they didn't realise that they had moved between pages. Only when we made the page heading the h1 - that users understood what page they were on.
    </p>

    <p class="rich-text">
    We found screen readers struggling to pronounce heading and sub-headings as one thing. They would read them separately which caused confusion so we've used <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags around the <code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code> to help screen readers read more naturally. We've also included <code>&lt;span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;</code> to add a natural pause.

        {{ designExample({
      type: 'typography-mini-hub-heading'
    }) }}



    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">
    Contents list
    </h3>

    <p>
   Use a <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/contents-list">contents list</a> at the top of the page to allow users to navigate around a small group of related pages (up to 8 pages), for example a group of pages about a specific condition. The example on this page is from the nhs.uk page about age-related macular degeneration.
    </p>

        {{ designExample({
      type: 'contents-list'
    }) }}

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">
    Pagination
    </h3>

    <p>
      Use <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/pagination">pagination</a>  at the bottom of the page to allow users to navigate around a small group of related pages (up to 8 pages), for example a group of pages about a specific condition.
    </p>

      type: 'pagination'

      Research on this pattern
    </h2>

    <p>
    The mini-hub pattern was created to work on NHS.UK conditions pages.
    </p>

    <p>
    While developing the pattern, we ran 3 rounds of research with users, including those with disabilities and people with low digital literacy on Age-related macular degeneration.
    </p>

    <p>
    The pattern was also reviewed by the Digital Accessibility Centre.
    </p>

    <p>
    In testing, the structure and labelling of the pages fitted the mental model of all users, helping them to understand the structure of the content.
    </p>

    <p>
    Users found the active link formatting on the menu helpful in knowing where they are. Some users felt that the links (in the content list) helped them understand what information there is, and choose what is relevant to them.
    </p>

    <p>
    The majority of users we tested with, including a user with very low digital skills - used pagination to navigate through pages and knew this was associated with the contents list at the top of the page.
