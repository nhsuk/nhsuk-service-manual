    <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/tree/master/packages/components/review-date">get the latest review date code</a> in the NHS.UK frontend library in GitHub.</p>
    <h2>How to use </h2>
    <p>The review date information should sit at the bottom of every page of clinical content on the NHS website to meet <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/tis/about/the-info-standard/">NHS England's information standard</a> . If the page includes embedded content such as a video, then the production/review date for that content should be contained within the component that holds that content.</p>
    <p>Don't make review dates the main focus of the page - review dates are low on users priority when seeking information.</p>
    <p>Don't hide the review dates; dates need to sit in context close to the content they relate to.</p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>The text currently meets AA accessibity standards with a contrast ratio of 6.99:1.</p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>We initally tested the review dates detatched from the content, closer to the footer of the page and separated by a rule - which users didn't notice. It wasn't until we removed the rule and brought closer that users read the dates and commented on them being helpful.</p>
