    <h2>How to use review date</h2>
    <p>The review date information should sit at the bottom of every page of clinical content on the NHS website to meet <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/tis/about/the-info-standard/">NHS England's information standard</a>.</p>
    <p>If the page includes embedded content such as a video, then the production/review date for that content should be contained within the component that holds that content.</p>
    <p>Don't make review dates the main focus of the page - review dates are low on users priority when seeking information.</p>
    <h2>How not to use review date</h2>
    <p>Don't hide the review dates; dates need to sit in context close to the content they relate to.</p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>The text currently meets AA accessibility standards with a contrast ratio of 6.99:1.</p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>The review date component was tested on a conditions page in three labs: 20th June 2018, 4th July 2018 and 16th July 2018.</p>
    <p>We initially tested review dates detached from the main content and closer to the footer of the page, separated by a rule, but users didn't notice the dates.</p>
    <p>It wasn't until we removed the rule and brought closer that users read the dates and commented on them being helpful.</p>

    <p>Discuss action links on the <a href="https://nhsuk.slack.com/messages/standards">NHS.UK #standards Slack channel</a> or email the standards team at <a href="mailto:service-manual@nhs.net">service-manual@nhs.net</a>.</p>
