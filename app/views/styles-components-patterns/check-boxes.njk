    <h2>When to use checkboxes</h2>
    <p><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/checkboxes/">GOV.UK Design System suggests</a> using the checkboxes component when you need to help users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>select multiple options from a list</li>
        <li>toggle a single option on or off</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>When not to use checkboxes</h2>
    <p>Do not use the checkboxes component if users can only choose one option from a selection. In this case, use the radios component.</p>
    <h2>How checkboxes work</h2>
    <p class="rich-text">Checkboxes are grouped together in a <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> that describes them, as shown in the examples on this page. This is usually a question, like ‘How would you like to be contacted?’.</p>
    <p class="rich-text">If you are asking just <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages/#start-by-asking-one-question-per-page">one question per page</a> as GOV.UK Design System recommended, you can set the contents of the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> as the page heading. This is good practice as it means that users of screen readers will only hear the contents once.</p>
    <p>Read more on the GOV.UK Design System about <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/labels-legends-headings/">why and how to set legends as headings</a>.</p>
    <p>Unlike with radios, users can select multiple options from a list of checkboxes. Do not assume that users will know how many options they can select based on the visual difference between radios and checkboxes alone. </p>
    <p>If needed, add a hint explaining this, for example, ‘Select all that apply’.</p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>We tested the checkbox component on a 'Register with a GP' prototype at two labs on 18th October 2018 and 11th December. </p>
    <p>Users understood the purpose of the component and were able to use it.</p>
    <p>Checkboxes have been tested in as part of a register for a GP journey in 2 labs. All users understood the action they performed and were able to successfully complete the set task.</p>
    <p>As our checkboxes are based on GOV.UK Design System components, they have a useful blog post which explains how they were developed and tested <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/30/weve-updated-the-radios-and-checkboxes-on-gov-uk/">https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/11/30/weve-updated-the-radios-and-checkboxes-on-gov-uk/</a></p>
