    <h2>When to use a warning callout</h2>
    <p>Use this callout for information that:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>is time critical</li>
          <li>could have a significant effect on someone's health</li>
          <li>addresses a common or significant misconception or mistake</li>
      </ul>
    <p>If the information is important but not important enough for a warning callout, use inset text instead.</p>
    <p>If you need to tell a user to contact their GP or get medical help, use a <a href="/service-manual/patterns/care-card">care card</a>.</p>

    <h2>How to use a warning callout</h2>
    <p>Give the callout a short, clearly worded heading. Headings help people scan the page for warnings and understand what's relevant to them.</p>
    <p>Make the callout concise, specific and self-contained. For example, don't introduce a callout with the words "If this happens...". Explain the circumstances.</p>
    <p>Don't break the flow with a callout. Think about whether you need it and the best place to put it.</p>
    <p>Don't overdo callouts. Avoid having more than 2 on a page. We want to reassure people, not to scare them.</p>
    <p>If possible, put at least 1 short paragraph of text between 2 callouts or between an action link and a callout.</p>
    <p>Give priority to <a href="">care cards</a> over callouts.</p>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>The heading and background contrast ratio is 11.92:1 and the content and background contrast ratio is 13.69:1. These go beyond AAA guidelines.</p>
    <p>We recommend adding an aria label, for example: aria-label="Important". This will help users with screen readers understand that the information is important. We still need to test this with users with access needs.</p>
    <p>If you can help with this, please get in touch on the <a href=""> NHS.UK #standards Slack channel</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:service-manual@nhs.net">service-manual@nhs.net</a>.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>In testing, users noticed the yellow callouts and understood them as a warning.</p>
    <p>Research shows that clearly worded callout headings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>help users spot relevant information quickly</li>
      <li>help users who cannot distinguish callouts by their colour</li>
      <li>are better than icons, which may not be accessible and can be interpreted in different ways</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Discuss</h2>
    <p>Discuss warning callouts on the <a href="">NHS.UK #standards Slack channel</a> or email the standards team at <a href="">service-manual@nhs.net</a>.</p>
