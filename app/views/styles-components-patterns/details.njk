    <h2 id="when-to-use-this-component">When to use details</h2>
    <p><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/select/">GOV.UK Design System suggest</a> using the details component to make a page easier to scan when it contains information that only some users will need.</p>
    <h2 id="when-not-to-use-this-component">When not to use details</h2>
    <p>Do not use the details component to hide information that the majority of your users will need.</p>
    <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
    <p>The details component is a short link that expands into more detailed help text when a user clicks on it.</p>
    <h3 id="write-clear-link-text">Write clear link text</h3>
    <p>Make the link text short and descriptive so users can quickly work out if they need to click on it.</p>
    <h2 id="research-on-this-component">Research</h2>
    <p>We tested the details component on conditions information pages and a 'Register with a GP' transactional prototype at five labs on 20th June 2018, 4th July 2018, 16th July 2018, 18th October 2018 and 11th December 2018. </p>
    <p>Users understood the purpose of the component and were able to use it.</p>
    <p>Anecdotally we've heard users being reluctant to expand the details component in user testing sessions for transactional services (forms). When asked why they wouldn't click they explained that they thought the link text (blue underlined text) would take them to a new page and they would lose their progress.</p>
    <p>If you’ve used this component, get in touch to share your user research findings.</p>
