            <p><a href="https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/components/contents-list.html">Preview the contents list component</a></p>
            <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/tree/master/packages/components/contents-list">get the latest contents list code</a> in the NHS.UK frontend library in GitHub.</p>

            <h2>When to use a contents list</h2>
                <p>Use the contents list component as a method of navigation for small groups (up to 8 pages) of related content, such as a group of pages on a specific condition.</p>
                <p>This component requires <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/paginantion">pagination</a> at the top of the page - both components together become the multi-page navigation pattern.</p>

            <h2>When not to use a contents list</h2>
                <p>Do not use the contents list component on non grouped pages or 'related' pages as it will likely confuse the user.</p>
                <p>Do not use contents list in the context of a transactional service or a form as these have their own means of navigation <a href="/service-manual/patterns/buttons">buttons</a> to move forward (progress) and <a href="/patterns/back-link">back link</a> to navigate back.</p>

            <h2>How to use </h2>
                <p>The <a href="/service-manual/patterns/contents-list">contents list</a> at the top of the page must be used in conjunction with the <a href="/service-manual/patterns/pagination">pagination component</a>, used at the bottom of each page.</p>

                <p>Keep links short and descriptive. Links that are too long (more than two lines) inhibit the scannability of this component.</p>

                <p>Page titles must reflect the subject of the specific page (e.g. ‘Treatment’), whilst the overall subject of the section must form the sub-header (e.g. ‘Age-related macular degeneration’). This is so users are clear where they have navigated to.</p>


            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p class="rich-text">The list of links is surrounded by a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element to indicate that they are navigation links. This element has an <code>aria-label</code> attribute with the value <code>Pages in this guide</code>. This will be read out by screen readers that support this attribute to help clarify what the list of links are.</p>

                <p class="rich-text">Additionally there is a visually hidden heading title <code>Contents</code> which will be read by screen readers as a heading to the links.</p>

                <p class="rich-text">If the link describes the current page that you are on, then it has the <code>aria-current="page"</code> value to indicate to screen readers that this is the case.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>The contents list component has been tested in the context of grouped / related information pages and guides, not on forms or 'related' pages.</p>
                <p>All users engaged with the contents list navigation, stating that it fits how they thought the content would be made up.</p>
                <p>Users found the active link formatting on the menu helpful in knowing where they are.</p>
                <p>Some users indicated that the page titles helped them orientate themselves, knowing they’re in the right place.</p>
                <p>Some felt that the links helped them to understand what information there is, and choose what is relevant to them.</p>
