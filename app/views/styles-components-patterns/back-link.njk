    <h2>When to use a back link</h2>
    <p><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK design system</a> suggests to always include the back link component <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/question-pages">question pages</a>.</p>
    <p>You can include a back link on other pages within a multi-page transaction, if it makes sense to do so.</p>
    <p>Make sure the text used in the link describes the action.</p>
    <h2>When not to use a back link</h2>
    <p>Never use the back link component together with breadcrumbs. If necessary, you should do research with your users to learn which they find more helpful in your service.</p>
    <p>Consider placement; don't have it close to other links or buttons as it might confuse the primary action on a page.</p>
    <h2>How a back link works</h2>
    <p><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/back-link/">GOV.UK</a> suggest that back links must always go at the top of a page, but a couple of our services; <a href="https://111.nhs.uk/">111.nhs.uk</a> and <a href="https://your-data-matters.service.nhs.uk">Find out why your NHS data matters</a> have found it to works better at the bottom of the page below the primary action, as this makes better sense to a screen reader (why would you suggest leaving a page before you know its purpose).</p>
    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>Consider the placement of the back link on a page, especially with screen readers in mind.</p>
    <p>Also, make sure the text used describes the action - don't rely on 'back' as it might not mirror the users expectation of a journey.</p>
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p><a href="https://111.nhs.uk/">111.nhs.uk</a> found users wanting to change their answers during testing so they introduced a back link and labelled it to 'change my previous answer'.</p>
    <p><a href="https://your-data-matters.service.nhs.uk/">Find out why your NHS data matters</a> received a recommendation from <a href="http://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility Centre</a> to place their back link below the primary action - as it was confusing to screen reader users to land on a page and to be immediately told to go back before the heading, or purpose of the page was read out.</p>
    <h2>Discuss</h2>
    <p>Discuss action links on the <a href="https://nhsuk.slack.com/messages/standards">NHS.UK #standards Slack channel</a> or email the standards team at <a href="mailto:service-manual@nhs.net">service-manual@nhs.net</a>.</p>
