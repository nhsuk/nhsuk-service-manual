      <p>Keyboard accessibility is one of the most important parts of accessibility. It enables other input methods, including switches, speech input and screen readers.</p>
      <p>The starting point for keyboard accessibility is to use the correct HTML for links, buttons and form controls. Use <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns">components from the service manual</a>, if you can. They've already been tested for keyboard accessibility.</p>

      <p>A good page title helps users find what they what and recognise they're in the right place. It's the link that shows in search results and the first thing a screenreader will read out when the user lands on a page.</p>
      <p>Each page title must be unique and descriptive. Keep it concise and consider putting important keywords near the beginning.</p>

      <p>ARIA (Accessibility Rich Internet Applications) adds extra information that lets people who use assistive technologies know what's going on. If a component needs more description than HTML provides, you need to mark it up with an ARIA  pattern. </p>
      <p>We use simple examples of ARIA in some of the service manual components, such as <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/details">details</a>, <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/breadcrumbs">breadcrumbs</a> and <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/error-message">error messages</a>.</p>

          <p>The W3C note on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/">using ARIA</a> is a good introduction.</p>
          <p>If you have a complex component, check whether it fits into a defined pattern from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/">ARIA authoring practices</a>. Patterns that might be useful are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#accordion">accordions</a></li>

          </ul>
          <p>If you use an ARIA pattern, include the ARIA attributes, take responsibility for the keyboard interactions as part of the scripting, and test it with assistive technology.</p>
          <p>Start with the <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns">components in the service manual</a>. They've already been tested. Another useful resource for accessible components is the <a href="https://inclusive-components.design/">Inclusive components</a> collection.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns">components</a> in the service manual are well tested and ready to use. Before you design a new component, please test an existing component and show that there's a clear need for something new.</p>
      <p>Discuss any new components with other members of your team. You need to make sure that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you have good evidence that the new component is the best way of meeting the user need</li>
        <li>it will be accessible</li>

        <li>you share what you've learnt</li>

      <p>People use their browser to change the size of content, and people with low vision may use that to a more extreme level. The guidelines specify a level of 320 (CSS) px wide. That is equivalent to 400% for a 1280px wide browser.</p>
      <p>Users can also override the font-family and spacing for text, which can break a fragile layout. We use this <a href="https://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/tsbookmarklet.html">text spacing bookmarklet</a> to test with.</p>

      <p>Some images are "functional". That means that they trigger an action. If people can't see the image, they need an alternative.</p>
      <p>Use "alt‑text" for images. W3C has information about <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/functional/">how to deal with different kinds of functional image</a>.</p>
