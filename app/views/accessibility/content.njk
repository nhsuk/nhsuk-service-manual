      <p>Clear content helps everyone and it's the most important thing you can do to make things accessible. It will help more people than any other accessibility requirement.</p>
      <p>NHS services should follow the <a href="/service-manual/content">content style guide</a>, including the guidance on <a href="/service-manual/content/create-content-for-users-with-low-health-literacy">health literacy</a> and <a href="/service-manual/content/inclusive-language">inclusive language</a>.</p>

      <p>A good page title helps users find what they what and recognise they're in the right place. It's the link that shows in search results and the first thing a screenreader will read out when the user lands on a page.</p>
      <p>Each page title must be unique and descriptive. Keep it concise and consider putting important keywords near the beginning.</p>

          <p>Put the label next to the form field so that the user is clear which field it relates to.</p>
          <p>Generally the label should be visible. (There's an example of a hidden label "Search the NHS website" on the search box in the NHS.UK header. It doesn't need a visible label because people can see the search icon and the word "Search" in the box.)</p>
          <p>Give grouped items a "legend". You can see examples in the <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/checkboxes">checkboxes</a> and <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/radios">radios</a> components in the service manual.</p>
          <p>To test the code is correct, you can usually click on the label and the field should be focused by the browser. Otherwise, check there is a "for" attribute on the label and that it matches the "id" attribute of the field.</p>

      <p>People who can't see a meaningful image need an alternative to understand the content. You need to add "alt-text" to explain what's in the image.</p>
      <p>You can see what alt-text an image has by viewing it with <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm">Chrome's Web Developer toolbar</a>.</p>

        </summary>
        <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
          <p>The content of the alt-text depends on the image and its context. If the image is part of the main content of the page (not a <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/testing#use-alternative-text-for-functional-images">functional image</a> - one that triggers an action), use the alt-text to describe the image in a way that makes sense in the context.</p>
          <p>You don't need to explain that it's an image because screenreaders usually announce that. Keep alt-text to a sentence or 2 and no longer than 250 characters.</p>
          <p>Imagine you were reading the page out to a friend. How would you describe the image?</p>
          <p>This is an image from the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bullous-pemphigoid/">NHS.UK bullous pemphigoid page</a>. It comes under a heading "Check if you have bullous pemphigoid". The alt-text is: "Lots of sore red patches with small blisters spread across white skin on a woman's chest." It explains what users can see in the picture.</p>

          <figure class="nhsuk-image nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">
            <img class="nhsuk-image__img" src="https://assets.nhs.uk/prod/images/S_0318_Bullous_pemphigoid_lesions_.2e16d0ba.fill-320x213.jpg" alt="Lots of sore red patches with small blisters spread across white skin on a woman's chest.">

              It can affect large areas of the body or limbs.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>The caption underneath the image assumes that the user can either see the image or read the alt-text. It shouldn't duplicate the alt-text. Instead, use it to explain why the image is there and what you want users to conclude from it - for example, how serious their symptom is or what stage their condition has reached.</p>
          <p>Here's another example. The alt-text is "Small red spots on white skin". The caption explains that that's how chickenpox starts.</p>

          <figure class="nhsuk-image nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">
            <img class="nhsuk-image__img" src="https://assets.nhs.uk/prod/images/ABF9YH_GDGeL2X.2e16d0ba.fill-320x213.jpg" alt="Small red spots on white skin">
            <figcaption class="nhsuk-image__caption nhsuk-image__caption--grey">
              1. Chickenpox starts with red spots. They can appear anywhere on the body.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>If you have a complex image that you can't describe in short alt-text (such as an infographic), include a longer description in some other way. You can use <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/expander">an expander</a>, for example, underneath the infographic with a text explanation.</p>
          <p>If your image has text which conveys its meaning, follow <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/development#use-alternative-text-for-functional-images">the guidance on functional images</a>. An example would be a link to a health app which includes a brand image and the name of the app. The app name says the same as the brand image, so the image doesn't need explaining.</p>
