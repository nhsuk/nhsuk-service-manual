      <h2>Identify target groups and accessibility challenges</h2>
      <p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/user-research">User research</a></p>
      <p>In the discovery part of the project, you need to understand how it will affect people with access needs. Consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>whether it will cause particular accessibility challenges</li>
        <li>whether it will affect disabled people differently</li>
        <li>how it might affect people with complex needs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, how will your project contact people? Some people can't make phone calls and some people can't read paper.</p>

          <p>Your organisation may have an internal network of people who have access needs. (NHS Digital has an Ability Network, for example.)

      <p>In the UK, almost 1 in 5 people have a disability of some kind. Many more have a temporary impairment like an illness or injury. Try to include 1 person with access needs in every 5 people you research with.</p>
      <p>Involving people with access needs in user research doesn't just help identify accessibility issues. It shows up general issues that affect everyone.</p>

You may be able to include people with other needs too if you adapt the scenario, for example, by using the wizard-behind-a-curtain method to explore screenreader interactions. (This is where users think that they are using a real system but in fact the researcher is controlling it.)</li>
            <li>Working HTML prototypes: you can test them with people with mobility, cognitive and vision (magnification) issues.</li>

      <h3>Recruitment agencies</h3>
      <p>Ask your agency to include people with access needs. If they say it's too hard or want to charge extra for this, get quotes from other recruiters. You should be able to find an agency that will recruit people with different needs at no extra cost.</p>

      <h3>Charities and voluntary organisations</h3>
      <p>Build relationships with organisations that represent or work with people who have access needs. They may be able to help find participants. Do not forget to tell them afterwards how their feedback and time has changed your product or service. Or offer them something in return, like training or advice.</p>

            <li>no vision, for example, someone who uses a screen reader</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Be prepared to go to people's homes. Some users can't get to a research lab or bring their tech with them. It can also help to see users in their natural environment. Go with a colleague (not on your own) and take any equipment you need. Get the user's permission to record in their home. Arrange a start and finish time and stick to it.</li>
            <li>Check that the venue is accessible. Can someone with a wheel chair get to the room? What about the toilets?</li>
            <li>Invite people to bring their own devices and plan any recording around that. It takes less time to adapt the recording than for someone to adapt to a device they haven't used before. Make sure that the thing you're testing is hosted somewhere where the user can access it and that there is free wifi for them. Consider making a short URL using Bitly, for example.</li>
            <li>Send forms (such as data protection forms) in an accessible Word document well before the session. Participants should not have to read a paper copy in order to take part. It's OK to ask them to sign the paper copy so long as it's identical to the version you sent them.</li>
            <li>Ask users if they need you to arrange transport for them. If so, use a taxi company with accessible vehicles and give the participant plenty of notice about pick up and drop off times.</li>

      <p>It's important that the team supports one another. Sometimes doing research with people who have access needs is tiring and emotional. Users might tell you stories that are hard to hear or you might see them struggle.</p>
      <p>It’s okay to take some time out during a day of research or, as a user researcher, to ask for someone to stand in for you.</p>
