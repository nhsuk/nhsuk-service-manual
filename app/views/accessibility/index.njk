  <p>Your service must be accessible to everyone who needs it. If it is not, you may be breaking the law.</p>
  <p>Everyone who works on NHS digital services has a role to play in making them accessible and inclusive.</p>

  <h2>Make sure your service meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</h2>
  <p>The service manual is up to date with WCAG 2.2.</p>
