  <p>Your service must be accessible to everyone who needs it. If it is not, you may be breaking the law.</p>
  <p>Everyone who works on NHS digital services has a role to play in making them accessible and inclusive.</p>

  <h2>Make sure your service meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</h2>
  <p>The service manual has been updated to meet WCAG 2.2. <a href="/accessibility/new-accessibility-requirements-wcag-2-2">Find out more about the new requirements</a>.</p>
  <p>Teams should comply now to make sure products and services are ready by October 2024. This is when the Government Digital Service, Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England will start monitoring accessibility according to WCAG 2.2.</p>
