  <p>Your service must be accessible to everyone who needs it. If it is not, you may be breaking the law.</p>
  <p>Everyone who works on NHS digital services has a role to play in making them accessible and inclusive.</p>

  <h2>Make sure your service meets the new WCAG 2.2 criteria</h2>
  <p>Public sector organisations have till October 2024 to come into line with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG 2.2</a> but teams should comply now.</p>
  <p><a href="https://nhsdigital.github.io/accessibility-checklist/">The NHS accessibility checklist</a> is already up to date with WCAG 2.2.</p>
  <p>This accessibility guidance is up to date with WCAG 2.1. We are currently reviewing it and will be updating it to reflect WCAG 2.2.</p>
