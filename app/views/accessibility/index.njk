  <p>Your service must be accessible to everyone who needs it. If it is not, you may be breaking the law.</p>
  <p>Everyone who works on NHS digital services has a role to play in making them accessible and inclusive.</p>

  <h2>Make sure your service meets WCAG 2.2 criteria</h2>
  <p>Teams should comply now to make sure products and services are ready by October 2024. This is when the Government Digital Service, Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England will start monitoring accessibility to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG 2.2</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://nhsdigital.github.io/accessibility-checklist/">The NHS accessibility checklist</a> is already up to date with WCAG 2.2.</p>
  <p>This accessibility guidance is up to date with WCAG 2.1. We are currently reviewing it and will be updating it to reflect WCAG 2.2.</p>
