      <p>Also add a skip link at the start of a long list of links or form fields (for example, over 20 checkboxes in a filter). This lets people who use keyboard-style access with a switch or head-wand skip to the end and avoid repetitive key-presses.</p>

      <p>It's easier for people to read and interact with content if you use colours that contrast well. The NHS meets at least level AA for contrast and we aim for AAA where possible.</p>

      <h3>AA</h3>
      <p>The contrast ratio should be at least:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4.5:1 for small text (smaller than 24px, or 19px if bold)</li>
        <li>3:1 for large text (larger than 24px, or 19px if bold) and components (like a text input field) and graphic elements (like an icon)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>AAA</h3>
      <p>The contrast ratio should be at least:</p>
      <ul>

          <p>If you are relying on users understanding a graphic (like an icon) without text, it must meet the minimum contrast ratio. If it also has text, it doesn't have to meet the requirement but this is still recommended.</p>
          <p>Components that are visible but not currently active (like a submit button that isn't active until you've filled in the form) are exempt from the requirement, but if you can meet the minimum contrast without it being confusing, that will help people with low vision.</p>

      <p>Everyone should be able to access all interactive components with a keyboard or a similar device. It must be obvious to them which element or link is the current focus position on the page. The browser default is generally not good enough.</p>
      <p>Make sure that the focus is clearly visible. You can do this by adding something, like an outline or icon, or changing the colour of part of the component. The change should have a good <a href="#check-colour-contrast">colour contrast</a>.</p>
