        <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
          <p>If the answer to any of these questions is 'yes', it's a sign that the project will need a higher level of accessibility expertise or support.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Does the project affect people with access needs differently?</h3>
          <p>For example, does the user's journey include physical access to a GP surgery? If so, include people who might find this difficult in your user research - for example, people with hearing, visual or mobility impairments. Read more about <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/user-research#involve-people-with-access-needs-at-every-stage">involving people with access needs</a> in user research.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Will the project use any technologies you haven't already tested for accessibility?</h3>
          <p>You will need to test them, and the team working on them will need a higher level of accessibility knowledge or support.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Is the project about a complex subject with lots of jargon?</h3>
          <p>You'll need to allow time to <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/content#write-content-thats-easy-to-understand">write content that's easy to understand</a>.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Will the interface need new components?</h3>
          <p>You should show that you've tested existing components and demonstrated a clear need for new ones. You must also make sure new components are accessible and test them.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Will there be a different colour scheme?</h3>
          <p>You'll need to test the colour combinations, both for text and graphical <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/design#check-colour-contrast">contrast</a>.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Will the project use multimedia, PDFs, infographics, large data tables or other less common content?</h3>
          <p>Check the capabilities of the systems and the people creating them so that you can be sure that they will be accessible.</p>

          <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">Is there a reason to include 'Easy Read' documents or translations?</h3>
          <p>If there is some key information that everyone must understand (such as a guide to a new national service), then consider including an Easy Read version for people with low-literacy or learning disabilities. Or you could link to Easy Read content from other organisations.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/product-and-delivery">Product and delivery</a></p>
      <p>It's the product or delivery manager's responsibility to make sure that the product or service is accessible. In most cases it's a matter of making sure that the team is checking their work as they go along.</p>
      <p>If in doubt, ask questions early. The sooner you consider accessibility requirements, the easier it is.</p>

          <p>For a large project, such as a new or replaced product or service or new functionality, you should record and be able to show that your team has:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>included accessibility requirements in your service design and user research</li>
            <li>tested its own work using the accessibility guidance for different activities</li>

          </ul>
          <p>If you test as you go along, the independent audit should find very little that needs changing. You will need the audit for your <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/product-and-delivery#publish-an-accessibility-statement">accessibility statement</a>.</p>
          <p>For smaller projects or a small update, you have more discretion. Internal testing may be enough. Your team should follow this accessibility guidance and focus on testing new components and content.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/service-manual/accessibility/product-and-delivery">Product and delivery</a></p>
      <p>New websites must have an accessibility statement from September 2019. Existing websites need one by September 2020, in line with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">new regulations</a>.</p>
      <p>For the statement, you must test every area of your product or service and report on issues that people with access needs might face. You should have as few accessibility issues as possible. Following this accessibility guidance will help you with that.</p>
      <p>GOV.UK has published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website">sample accessibility statement</a>.
