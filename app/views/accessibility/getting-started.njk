  <h2 id="book-a-session-in-an-accessibility-lab">Book a session in an accessibility lab</h2>
  <p>An accessibility lab will give you hands-on experience of some of the technologies that people use with online services. Some labs also have goggles that simulate visual impairments and headphones to simulate hearing loss.</p>
  <p>NHS England has its own accessibility lab. NHS England staff can find information on the intranet about how to book it.</p>

  <h2 id="try-out-assistive-technologies">Try out assistive technologies</h2>
  <p>Get some understanding of how different technologies work. Use a screenreader, for example, and check how your web pages or other websites perform.</p>
  <p>If you have a Mac, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/mac/vision/">try out VoiceOver</a>, or <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/download/">download NVDA for Windows</a>.</p>
  <p>If you're not confident about doing this, book a session in an accessibility lab first.</p>

  <h2 id="talk-to-other-people-with-an-interest-in-accessibility">Talk to other people with an interest in accessibility</h2>
  <p>Join the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/accessibility-community">GOV.UK accessibility community</a> or talk to NHS colleagues on our <a href="/slack">public Slack workspace</a> to get advice and support, stay up to date and share examples.</p>
