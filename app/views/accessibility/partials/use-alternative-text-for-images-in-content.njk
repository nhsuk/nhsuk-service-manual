<p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/accessibility/content">Content</a>, <a href="/accessibility/design">Design</a>, <a href="/accessibility/testing">Testing</a></p>
<p>People who cannot see a meaningful image need an alternative to understand the content. You need to add "alt-text" to explain what's in the image. Alt-text is not usually visible but is read out by screen readers or displayed if an image does not load or if images have been switched off.</p>
<p>You can see what alt-text an image has by viewing it with <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm">Chrome's Web Developer toolbar</a>.</p>

      Informative images
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <p>The content of the alt-text depends on the image and its context. If the image is part of the main content of the page (not a functional image - one that triggers an action), use the alt-text to describe the image in a way that makes sense in the context.</p>
    <p>You don't need to explain that it's an image because screen readers usually announce that.</p>
    <p>Keep alt-text to a sentence or 2 and ideally under 125 characters including spaces. If there's important information that you cannot fit in 125 characters (for example, you're describing a complex chart), include this information in the alt-text or consider linking to more information for screen reader users. (For example, the NHS website team is testing long descriptions to describe images of conditions appearing on a range of skin tones.)</p>
    <p>Imagine you were reading the page out to a friend. How would you describe the image?</p>
    <p>This is an image from the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bullous-pemphigoid/">bullous pemphigoid page on the NHS website</a>. It comes under a heading "Check if you have bullous pemphigoid". The alt-text is: "Lots of sore red patches with small blisters spread across white skin on a woman's chest." It explains what users can see in the picture.</p>

    <figure class="nhsuk-image nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">
      <img class="nhsuk-image__img" src="https://assets.nhs.uk/prod/images/S_0318_Bullous_pemphigoid_lesions_.2e16d0ba.fill-320x213.jpg" alt="Lots of sore red patches with small blisters spread across white skin on a woman's chest.">

        It can affect large areas of the body or limbs.

    <p>This example has a caption underneath the image as well as alt-text. Read about captions and how they work with alt-text in the <a href="/design-system/components/images">images</a> component.</p>
    <p>If you have a complex image that you cannot describe in short alt-text (such as an infographic), include a longer description in some other way. <a href="/content/inclusive-content/skin-symptoms#provide-a-long-description">Find out how to provide a long description in our skin symptoms guidance</a>.</p>
    <p>If your image has text which conveys its meaning, follow <a href="/accessibility/development#use-alternative-text-for-functional-images">the guidance on functional images</a>. An example would be a link to a health app which includes a brand image and the name of the app. The app name says the same as the brand image, so the image doesn't need explaining.</p>

    <p>Decorative images are there to attract users' attention or motivate them, but they don't help users understand the topic. An example might be a bowl of fruit on a healthy eating page.</p>
    <p>If your image is decorative, give it a null text alternative like this: (<code>alt=""</code>).</p>
