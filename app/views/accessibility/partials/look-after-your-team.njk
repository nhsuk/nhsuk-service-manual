<p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/accessibility/user-research">User research</a></p>
<p>It's important that the team supports one another. User research in health can be tiring and emotional. Sometimes users might tell you stories that are hard to hear or you might see them struggle.</p>
<p>It's OK to take some time out during a day of research or, as a user researcher, to ask for someone to stand in for you.</p>
<p>Check in with your team mates during and after research and take time to reflect together.</p>
