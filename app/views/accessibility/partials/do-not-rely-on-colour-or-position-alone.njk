<p>Do not rely on colour to convey meaning, for example, an instruction. To communicate with people who cannot see well or distinguish colours, you may need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>word things differently</li>
  <li>use more than one visual cue, for example, text and an icon as well as colour</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not rely on people understanding instructions that refer to the position of page elements.</p>

    <p>If someone is:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>using a screenreader, they may not see the colour - and position, for them, is simply up or down</li>
