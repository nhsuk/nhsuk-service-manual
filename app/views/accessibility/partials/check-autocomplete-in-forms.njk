<p>If you need information only from the person who is filling the form, make sure it has the autocomplete attribute.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#sec-autofill">W3C autofill table</a> tells you which attribute to use for each type of form field.</p>
<p>If the form can be filled in for someone else, this isn't necessary.</p>
