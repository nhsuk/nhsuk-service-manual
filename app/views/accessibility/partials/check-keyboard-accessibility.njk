<h2 id="check-keyboard-accessibility">Check keyboard accessibility</h2>
<p>Keyboard accessibility is one of the most important parts of accessibility. It enables other input methods, including switches, speech input and screen readers.</p>
<p>The starting point for keyboard accessibility is to use the correct HTML for links, buttons and form controls. Use <a href="/design-system/components">components from the service manual</a>, if you can. They've already been tested for keyboard accessibility.</p>
