      <ul>
        <li>Ideally link text should match the heading of the target page. If  the target page has the heading "Sleep and tiredness", that's good link text.</li>
        <li>If the target page heading is too long, shorten it but use words from it so that users can predict where the link will take them.</li>
        <li>Avoid ambiguous phrases such as "click here", "read more" and "find out more". It's OK to say: "Read more about <u>how to deal with stress</u>."</li>
        <li>If links open in a new window, say this in the link phrase. For example, "Link name (opens in new window)".</li>
        <li>If the link goes to a document, include the file type and size in the link phrase. For example: "Link name (PDF, 200KB)".</li>

      <p>You can use the same text for multiple links when they're in a good structure. The table row headings together with the link text must make the meaning clear.</p>
      <p>Here's an example: a list of form fields in a table, with "Change" links at the end of each row.</p>
