<p>Consider using video as well as text. Some people find it easier to understand.</p>
<p>With all video and animation, make sure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the interface is accessible for keyboard and screen reader users (including play/pause buttons and the location slider)</li>
  <li>if the user cannot see or hear it, they can still understand it</li>
</ul>
<p>To meet the accessibility regulations for public sector organisations, most new videos you've published or updated after 23 September 2020 must have these 3 kinds of alternative content.</p>

      Audio description
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <p>Audio description provides content for people who are blind or cannot see the video well. It is additional commentary that describes what's happening on screen in between narration, including any text, graphics or scene changes in the video.</p>
    <p>You must include an audio description for any key information that's visible on the screen but not part of the soundtrack, for example diagrams without a verbal description. If all the visual information in the video is included in the regular soundtrack, you do not need an audio description.</p>
    <p>If the video says the same thing as the page content, you do not need an audio description but you must make it clear that the video is an alternative to the text content. Our experience tells us, however, that even in these cases audio description can be valuable to blind people, some of whom do not read the page content.</p>
    <p>For audio description, you can do 1 of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>publish an alternative version of the video with audio description added in relevant places</li>
      <li>add a separate audio description track (if the media player supports this)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have a separate audio description track, make sure it includes the audio description voice-over and the original video audio (mixed and synced together). The audio description track must be the same length in seconds as the main videoâ€™s audio.</p>

      Closed captions (sometimes called subtitles)
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <p>People who are Deaf or have hearing loss may find captions helpful. Closed captions are a text alternative to audio information in video and animations that you can turn on or off.</p>
    <p>Use closed captions rather than subtitles. They look similar but subtitles are only a text alternative for dialogue, while closed captions are a text alternative for all the audio, including important background noises.</p>

    <p>Closed captions must include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>the words people say</li>
      <li>who is speaking, if it's not obvious, or where they are (for example, off-screen)</li>
      <li>important sounds like music, laughter or a door slamming</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Check that any auto-generated captions are accurate and synchronise them with the visual content.</p>
      <p>Use a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for the text. If possible, use a fully opaque (no transparency) coloured box behind the text. We recommend a black background with white text. Find out more about <a href="/design-system/styles/colour#accessibility">using colour and accessibility</a>, including colour contrast.</p>
      <p>For caption fonts, follow the <a href="/design-system/styles/typography">typography guidance</a> in the design system.</p>

      Transcript

  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <p>Transcripts provide audio and video content for people who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>are both Deaf and blind
      <li>people who process text information better than audio and visual information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's best practice to provide a transcript for a video but it is not required to pass WCAG2.1 AA. You must, however, provide a transcript for any audio-only content, such as a podcast.</p>
    <p>A transcript should include all the dialogue, relevant sound effects, and audio description content.</p>

  </div>
</details>
<p>There are rare exceptions, and you do not have to meet these requirements with videos published before 23 September 2020.</p>
<p>To meet an extra AAA requirement, add British Sign Language (BSL) to pre-recorded video content. Find out about the <a href="/content/british-sign-language-BSL-quality-assurance-standard">BSL quality assurance standard</a>.</p>
