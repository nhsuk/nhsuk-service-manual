<h2 id="set-language">Set language</h2>
<p>You need a small bit of markup on every page for screenreaders (and search engines) to know what language the content (or a part of the content) is in.</p>

{% call details({
  summaryText: "How to code for language"
}) %}
  <p>In the HTML element, set the language for the whole page to English:</p>
  <pre class="rich-text"><code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</code></pre> or whatever language the page is in.</p>
  <p>If there are changes of language within the page, mark these up as well:</p>
  <pre class="rich-text"><code>&lt;p&gt;Make sure you are treated by a state healthcare provider in France (&lt;span lang="fr"&gt;conventionné&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>You can apply the lang attribute to any container.</p>
{% endcall %}
