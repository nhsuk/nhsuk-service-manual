        WCAG 2.2
    </strong>
</p>
<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 adds 9 new "success criteria" for improving web accessibility. 6 of the new WCAG 2.2 criteria are graded at the A and AA level, meaning that they're considered a requirement for websites and mobile apps in UK government. You can <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/">learn more about WCAG 2.2 from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>.</p>
<p>WCAG 2.2 was published in October 2023. You should comply now to make sure products and services are ready by October 2024.</p>

<h3>The 6 new criteria you'll need to meet</h3>
<h4>Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)</h4>
<p>Some websites may have "sticky" headings or footers that will remain at the top or bottom of the page. This can obscure focus when navigating with a keyboard making it difficult to identify which components are actually in focus.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html">Learn more about Focus not Obscured (minimum)</a></p>

<h4>Dragging Movements</h4>
<p>If the nature of content requires it to be moved it must be able to be done with a "single pointer". A good alternative would be to have a user click on the content and then the destination rather than hold down the interaction and move it which some users may find impossible.</p>

<h4>Target Size (Minimum)</h4>
<p>Interactive content has to have a minimum size of 24 by 24 CSS pixels. This does not apply to interactive content that is a part of text such as links.</p>

<h4>Redundant Entry</h4>
<p>A user shouldn't have to enter information several times while on the site unless it is required for security purposes e.g. passwords.</p>

<h4>Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</h4>
<p>A user should not have to perform a cognitive function test e.g. identifying traffic lights unless they have provided the non-text content e.g. photo of their pet. If required to memorise a password the user should have the ability to copy and paste the information.</p>

<h4>Consistent Help</h4>
<p>If a user is given options to obtain help e.g. phone number, email address or live chat widget they should be presented in the same order to ensure that they can be easily identified and interacted with.</p>
