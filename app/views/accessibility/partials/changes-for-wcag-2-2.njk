        WCAG 2.2
    </strong>
</p>
<p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 adds 9 new "success criteria" for improving web accessibility. 6 of the new WCAG 2.2 criteria are graded at the A and AA level, meaning that they're considered a requirement for websites and mobile apps in the NHS. You can <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/">learn more about WCAG 2.2 from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>.</p>
<p>WCAG 2.2 was published in October 2023. You should comply now to make sure products and services are ready by October 2024.</p>

<p>The 6 new criteria you'll need to meet:</p>

<h3>Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)</h3>
<p>Some websites have "sticky" or "fixed" headings or footers that will remain at the top or bottom of the page when users scroll. This can hide focus when navigating with a keyboard by making it difficult to identify which components are focused. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html">Learn more about Focus not Obscured (minimum)</a></p>

<h3>Dragging Movements</h3>
<p>If there is interactive content that can be moved by the user by "dragging" it must be able to be done with a "single pointer". For example, to reorder items in a list that can be dragged, an alternative can be to have up and down arrows to reorder the items, this avoids clicking and dragging, which is impossible for some users. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements.html">Learn more about Dragging Movements</a></p>

<h3>Target Size (Minimum)</h3>
<p>Interactive content must have a minimum size of 24 by 24 CSS pixels. This does not apply to interactive content that is a part of text such as links. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html">Learn more about Target Size (minimum)</a></p>

<h3>Redundant Entry</h3>
<p>A user shouldn't have to enter the same information more than once while on a single journey, unless it is required for security purposes e.g. passwords. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/redundant-entry.html">Learn more about Redundant Entry</a></p>

<h3>Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</h3>
<p>A user should not have to perform a "cognitive function test" e.g. solving a puzzle or "Enter the 3rd, 4th, and 6th character of your password". If required to memorise a password the user should have the ability to copy and paste the information. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-minimum.html">Learn more about Accessible Authentication (minimum)</a></p>

<h3>Consistent Help</h3>
<p>If help options are provided e.g. contact details or live chat, they should be presented consitently across pages, to ensure that they can be easily identified and interacted with. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help.html">Learn more about Consistent Help</a></p>

<p>We've made changes to the design system to meet these criteria, see the full list of <a href="/accessibility/wcag2-2">WCAG 2.2 design system updates</a>.</p>
