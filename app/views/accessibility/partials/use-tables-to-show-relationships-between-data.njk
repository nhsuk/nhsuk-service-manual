<h2 id="use-tables-to-show-relationships-between-data">Use tables to show relationships between data</h2>
<p>Tables make it easier for users to understand logical relationships between bits of data or information.</p>
<p>Only use tables when there is a relationship between the "header" cells and the "data" cells in the grid. Assistive technologies announce the header with the data it refers to.</p>

  <p>Here is an example from the <a href="/design-system/components/table">tables component</a> in the service manual.</p>

  {{ table({
    caption: "Skin symptoms and possible causes",
    classes: "nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-5",
    responsive: true,
    head: [
      {
        text: "Skin symptoms"
      },
      {
        text: "Possible cause"
      }
    ],
    rows: [
      [
        {
          header: "Skin symptoms",
          text: "Blisters on lips or around the mouth"
        },
        {
          header: "Possible cause",
          text: "cold sores"
        }
      ],
      [
        {
          header: "Skin symptoms",
          text: "Itchy, dry, cracked, sore"
        },
        {
          header: "Possible cause",
          text: "eczema"
        }
      ],
      [
        {
          header: "Skin symptoms",
          text: "Itchy blisters"
        },
        {
          header: "Possible cause",
          text: "shingles, chickenpox"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }) }}

  <p>Screen readers would read out the last row as: "Skin symptoms: itchy blisters. Possible cause: shingles, chickenpox".</p>
