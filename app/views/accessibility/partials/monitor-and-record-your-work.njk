<p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/accessibility/product-and-delivery">Product and delivery</a></p>
<p>You must show that your team:</p>
<ul>
  <li>has carried out accessibility tests at each stage of the project</li>
  <li>has user tested the product or service, including with people with access needs</li>
  <li>has acted on the results</li>
</ul>
<p>The kind of tests and checks you need depend on the scale of your project, the kind of changes you're making, and the stage it's at.</p>

  <h3>Large projects</h3>
    <p>For a large project, such as a new or replaced product or service or new functionality, you should record and be able to show that your team has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>included accessibility requirements in your service design and user research</li>
      <li>tested its own work using the accessibility guidance for different activities</li>
      <li>tested any new technologies or components</li>
      <li><a href="/accessibility/user-research#involve-people-with-access-needs-at-every-stage">involved people with access needs</a> in usability testing</li>
      <li>completed an independent accessibility audit and allowed time to make changes before your product or service goes live</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you test as you go along, the independent audit should find very little that needs changing. You will need the audit for your <a href="/accessibility/product-and-delivery#publish-an-accessibility-statement">accessibility statement</a>.</p>
    <h3>Small projects</h3>
    <p>For smaller projects or a small update, you have more discretion. Internal testing may be enough. Your team should follow this accessibility guidance and focus on testing new components and content.</p>
