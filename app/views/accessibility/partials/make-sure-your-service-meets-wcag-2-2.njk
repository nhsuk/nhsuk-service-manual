</p>
<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 adds 9 new "success criteria" for improving web accessibility. 6 of the new criteria are graded at the A and AA level, which means they're a requirement for websites and mobile apps in the NHS. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/">Learn more about WCAG 2.2 from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).</a></p>
<p>WCAG 2.2 was published in October 2023. You should comply now to make sure products and services are ready by October 2024.</p>
