<p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/accessibility/user-research">User research</a></p>

<h3>Recruitment agencies</h3>
<p>Ask your agency to include people with access needs. If they say it's too hard or want to charge extra for this, get quotes from other recruiters. You should be able to find an agency that will recruit people with different needs at no extra cost.</p>

<h3>Charities and voluntary organisations</h3>
<p>Build relationships with organisations that represent or work with people who have access needs. They may be able to help find participants. Do not forget to tell them afterwards how their feedback and time has changed your product or service. Or offer them something in return, like training or advice.</p>

    <p>The mix of participants will vary depending on the type of research or interface you're testing. During the project, try to include people with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>learning and cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, ADHD, or a learning or intellectual disability</li>
      <li>limited mobility, for example, someone who uses voice or another alternative input or who has a disability which makes it difficult to use a mouse</li>
      <li>low vision, for example, someone who adjusts their computer with a screen magnifier or zoom controls</li>
      <li>no vision, for example, someone who uses a screen reader</li>
      <li>no hearing - you may need a sign language interpreter at the same time</li>
