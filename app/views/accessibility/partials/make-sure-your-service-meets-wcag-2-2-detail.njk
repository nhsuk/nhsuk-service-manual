</p>
<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 adds 9 new "success criteria" for improving web accessibility. 6 of the new criteria are graded at the A and AA level, which means they're a requirement for websites and mobile apps in the NHS. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/">Learn more about WCAG 2.2 from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).</a></p>
<p>WCAG 2.2 was published in October 2023. You should comply now to make sure products and services are ready by October 2024.</p>

<p>These are the 6 new criteria you'll need to meet.</p>

<h3>Focus not obscured (minimum)</h3>
<p>Some websites have "sticky" or "fixed" headers or footers that remain at the top or bottom of the page when users scroll. This can make it difficult for users navigating with a keyboard to identify which components are focused. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-minimum.html">Learn more about focus not obscured (minimum) on WCAG 2.2 website.</a></p>

<h3>Dragging movements</h3>
<p>If there is interactive content that users can move by "dragging", they must be able to do it with a "single pointer". For example, to reorder items in a list that can be dragged, an alternative can be to have up and down arrows to reorder them. Clicking and dragging is impossible for some users. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements.html">Learn more about dragging movements on WCAG 2.2 website.</a></p>

<h3>Target size (minimum)</h3>
<p>Interactive content must have a minimum size of 24 by 24 CSS pixels. This does not apply to interactive content that is a part of text such as links. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html">Learn more about target size (minimum) on WCAG 2.2 website.</a></p>

<h3>Redundant entry</h3>
<p>A user should not have to enter the same information more than once on a single journey, unless it is required for security purposes, for example passwords. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/redundant-entry.html">Learn more about redundant entry on WCAG 2.2 website.</a></p>

<h3>Accessible authentication (minimum)</h3>
<p>A user should not have to perform a "cognitive function test", such as solving a puzzle or "Enter the 3rd, 4th, and 6th character of your password". If you need the user to enter a password, they should be able to copy and paste it. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-minimum.html">Learn more about accessible authentication (minimum) on WCAG 2.2 website.</a></p>

<h3>Consistent help</h3>
<p>If your service provides help options such as contact details or live chat, they should be presented consistently across pages, to make sure users can find and interact with them easily. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help.html">Learn more about consistent help on WCAG 2.2 website.</a></p>

<p>We've made changes to the design system to meet these criteria. See the full list of <a href="/accessibility/web-content-accessibility-guidelines-2-2">WCAG 2.2 design system updates</a>.</p>
