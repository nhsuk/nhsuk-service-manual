<p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/accessibility/product-and-delivery">Product and delivery</a></p>
<p>New websites must have an accessibility statement from September 2019. Existing websites need one by September 2020, in line with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps">new accessibility regulations</a>.</p>
<p>For the statement, you must test every area of your product or service and report on issues that people with access needs might face. You should have as few accessibility issues as possible. Following this accessibility guidance will help you with that.</p>
<p>GOV.UK has published a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website">sample accessibility statement</a>. You can see a live example on the <a href="https://your-data-matters.service.nhs.uk/accessibilitystatement">NHS Your data matters service.</a></p>
