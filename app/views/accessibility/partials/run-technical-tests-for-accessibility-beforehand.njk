<p class="nhsuk-body-s">For: <a href="/accessibility/user-research">User research</a></p>
<p>Check that the thing you're testing is technically accessible - for example, that it works for people who use screen readers or voice input.</p>
<p>This applies to your survey software too. If you're using Qualtrics, as many user researchers do, be aware that it's not fully accessible.</p>

    <p>For basic surveys, asking users to write something in a text box or to select from a few options, your software should be OK. But people who use assistive technologies may have problems with matrix tables, rank order or slider questions.</p>
    <p>Test your survey with assistive technologies, including a screen reader, keyboard, in high contrast mode, and by zooming in to 400% at least.</p>
