<p>Consider using video as well as text. Some people find it easier to understand.</p>
<p>With all video and multimedia, make sure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the interface is accessible for keyboard and screen reader users (including play/pause buttons and the location slider)</li>
  <li>if the user cannot see or hear it, they can still understand it</li>
</ul>

    <p>If you are using a video on its own (in other words, if you don't repeat the video content elsewhere on the page), it must have a transcript. The transcript should include all the dialogue, relevant sound effects, and visual content.</p>
    <p>If the video includes dialogue, it should also have captions.</p>
    <p>If the video relies on visual content to convey information (for example, diagrams without a verbal description), it's best to include an audio description. This isn't essential but you must have a transcript.</p>

    <p>Make it clear that the video is an alternative to the text content. Put the video near the top of the page so that people don't have to work through the text to find it.</p>
