<p>Everyone should be able to access all interactive components with a keyboard or a similar device. It must be obvious to them which element or link is the current focus position on the page. The browser default is generally not good enough.</p>
<p>Make sure that the focus is clearly visible. You can do this by adding something, like an outline or icon, or changing the colour of part of the component. <a href="#check-colour-contrast">Check the colour contrast</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend the focus style in the <a href="/service-manual/understanding-focus-state-styles">NHS.UK frontend library</a>.</p>
