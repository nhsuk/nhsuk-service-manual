      Manual testing
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <p>Manual checks are the most efficient way to test for accessibility issues on individual pages or components.</p>
    <p>Use this guidance and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-insights-fo/pbjjkligggfmakdaogkfomddhfmpjeni">Microsoft's Accessibility Insights Chrome extension</a>.</p>
    <p>It is important to <a href="/accessibility/getting-started">learn about accessibility</a> before you start. Otherwise you can waste time wondering about things which aren't a problem or disagreeing with your colleagues.</p>
