<h2 id="understand-types-of-testing">Understand types of testing</h2>
<p>There are 3 types of accessibility testing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>testing with people - see the guidance on <a href="/accessibility/user-research">user research</a></li>
  <li>automated testing</li>
  <li>manual testing with guidelines</li>
</ul>

{% call details({
  summaryText: "Automated testing"
}) %}
  <p>Make automated testing part of your build process or use it for a scan across your website or parts of it. Remember that automated tests only check some of what you need to test.</p>
{% endcall %}

{% call details({
  summaryText: "Manual testing"
}) %}
  <p>Manual checks are the most effective way to test for accessibility issues on individual pages or components.</p>
  <p>Use this guidance and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-insights-fo/pbjjkligggfmakdaogkfomddhfmpjeni">Microsoft's Accessibility Insights Chrome extension</a>.</p>
  <p>It is important to <a href="/accessibility/getting-started">learn about accessibility</a> before you start. Otherwise you can waste time wondering about things which aren't a problem or disagreeing with your colleagues.</p>
