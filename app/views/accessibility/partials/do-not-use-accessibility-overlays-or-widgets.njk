  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <p>Accessibility overlays are toolbars or plugins that let users customise the web page display.</p>
    <p>They typically sit in the banner or a corner of the page, sometimes obscuring key functionality. They often use icons that can be difficult for users to understand. When clicked on, an overlay may pop up and create a barrier that users can't get past.</p>
  </div>
</details>

<p>Overlays and widgets can create problems for people when they get tapped accidentally or when they cover up information. People find them confusing and unhelpful.</p>
<p>People with access needs often use their preferred assistive technologies across all websites. Widgets only meet some access needs and only deal with one part of a user journey. They cannot hand over from one system or site to another. What helps people with access needs more are well-designed, well-structured websites that are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>built from the bottom up with accessibility-tested code and designs, like the <a href="/design-system/production">NHS production code</a> and <a href="/design-system">design system</a></li>
  <li>tested with users with access needs â€“ find out more in the section on <a href="/accessibility/user-research">user research</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Accessibility overlays and widgets cannot make a website fully compliant with accessibility standards or protect you from legal action.</p>
