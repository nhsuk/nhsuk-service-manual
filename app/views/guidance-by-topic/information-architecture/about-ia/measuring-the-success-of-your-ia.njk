  <p>You should have a measurement framework in place. This will be different for every team, depending on your key performance indicators. You need to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>know what success looks like</li>
    <li>have base-lined any measures</li>
    <li>can evidence that your IA is successful</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To meet your users' and organisational needs, you need to demonstrate the following for any new or transformed content.</p>

  <h2>You can demonstrate success through analytics</h2>
  <p>Benchmark your existing IA and content performance during discovery. Then show improvements in beta and live.</p>
  <p>Make sure you understand your users' priority tasks and show you get more people to the information they need more easily.</p>
  <p>Show that your IA helps more users:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>find known content – you can measure this, for example, through tree tests</li>
    <li>discover unknown content – site analytics can measure journeys through content (not just single page visits)</li>
    <li>start relevant transactional journeys</li>
    <li>visit high priority content that helps them do their most common tasks – "top tasks"</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Users find content through search engines</h2>
  <h3>Search engine optimisation (SEO) for external search engines</h3>
  <p>For your topic to rank highly in external search engines, you need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a clear structure, with pages grouped in a way that makes sense to users and links to navigate through all the pages</li>
    <li>content, with words your users use</li>
    <li>titles that relate to the content of the page and use words your users use</li>
    <li>metadata</li>
    <li>to address accessibility, with correct page mark up and alt tags for images</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you've changed the IA around an existing topic, it may affect search results. Baseline your search ranking and traffic from search engines and measure again when you've improved your structure and labelling. (If your content is on the NHS website, it has such authority that it's difficult to harm its Google rankings.)</p>
  <p>For new topics, monitor search rankings for key words when they go live and then review them.</p>
  <h3>Internal search</h3>
  <p>Large websites benefit from an on-site search engine. If you have one, your site search logs should show that users find your content through it.</p>
  <p>Add synonyms for your topic and prioritise results.</p>

  <h2>You have based your IA on user needs</h2>
  <p>Show that you've designed, tested and iterated your IA based on user research. This means users can browse to all your content.</p>
  <p>If you're adding to an existing website, you should show that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>you meet side-wide user needs as well as topic user needs</li>
    <li>you know about any larger content group your topic belongs to</li>
    <li>the labels you use sit meaningfully alongside existing content</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>You can show that users pick up a good information scent</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Users looking for your topic find it when they start from elsewhere on the website.</li>
    <li>The way you've grouped content and the labels you've used lead users to what they're interested in.</li>
    <li>You've considered users' journeys around the wider topic and linked to associated conditions, treatments, lifestyle improvements or services.</li>
    <li>You include links and synonyms in visible indexes – an example is the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/">Health A to Z on the NHS website</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>You have page templates for different levels of your IA</h2>
  <p>IA page templates help users navigate from larger to smaller topics. They also help search engines understand the relationships between and the importance of different pages by providing a clear structure.</p>
  <p>If you're publishing a topic on the NHS website, you need strong evidence for any changes to the website IA templates.</p>

  <h2>You have agreed any NHS website changes with the IA team</h2>
  <p>If you're publishing content on the NHS website, talk to the NHS.UK IA team early on so that your topic fits with the IA and navigation system as a whole.</p>
  <p>You need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>to agree where the topic fits in the wider NHS website IA and taxonomy</li>
    <li>topic links and synonyms in the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/">NHS website Health A to Z</a>, if appropriate – all designed, tested and added</li>
    <li>all topic content available via hub pages</li>
    <li>any related content available in the right context</li>
    <li>consistent links, page titles and URLs throughout</li>
    <li>a content inventory that lists all related content across the NHS website</li>
    <li>to follow the NHS website URL policy, with a clear URL structure and machine- and human-readable URLs</li>
  </ul>
