  <h2>A good IA creates better, more sustainable websites</h2>
  <p>Websites grow and evolve over time. By structuring your content and representing that structure to users in the navigation, you will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>help more users find good information</li>
    <li>increase the number of people who can do things themselves</li>
    <li>make it easier and less time-consuming for editors to manage, maintain and link content</li>
    <li>create a more sustainable publishing platform, better prepared for future innovations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="a-good-ia-gives-users-context">A good IA gives users context</h2>

  <p>It underpins user experience by helping users with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>placemaking</li>
    <li>orientation</li>
    <li>navigation</li>
    <li>search</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Placemaking</h3>
  <p>Placemaking is about users understanding what the website is for and what it offers. The way you group, name and display content helps people understand the scope of the website and how useful it will be to them.</p>

  <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
   <p>On the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS website</a>, the global navigation in the main navigation bar works hardest to communicate what the website offers.</p>

   <figure class="nhsuk-image nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">
      <img class="nhsuk-image__img" src="/assets/placemaking.png" alt="An image showing the header bar with the NHS logo, a search area and spaces for five top level navigation items">
      <figcaption class="nhsuk-image__caption">
        Image of the main nav based on the NHS website TBC
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>


  <h3>Orientation</h3>
  <p>Orientation is about users understanding where they are and where else they could go. Your IA lets them know if they're in the right place and what else might be of interest to them.</p>
  <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
   <p>On the NHS website, the global navigation (like the main navigation bar) helps users orient themselves. So do local navigation structures like:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>hub pages</li>
    <li>breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>page titles</li>
    <li>headings</li>
  </ul>

   <figure class="nhsuk-image nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">
      <img class="nhsuk-image__img" src="/assets/orientation-v2.png" alt="Image of two different hub pages">
      <figcaption class="nhsuk-image__caption">
        Image showing two levels of hub pages with breadcrumbs and headings TBC
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <h3>Navigation</h3>
  <p>Your IA helps users get to where they need to go. It gives them a good information scent to follow to find the content they need.</p>
  <div class="nhsuk-inset-text nhsuk-u-margin-top-4">
    <h4 id="information-scent">Information scent</h4>
    <p>Users pick up visual and textual cues about the content a website contains, including from its IA and link labels. These help them estimate the value of following a link.</p>
    <p>Users follow an information scent from what they see, but they also rely on what they already know.</p>
  </div>
   <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
   <p>On the NHS website, global navigation structures, like the main navigation bar, help users browse to their destination. So do local navigation structures, like hub pages or page to page navigation.</p>


   <figure class="nhsuk-image nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">
      <img class="nhsuk-image__img" src="/assets/navigation.png" alt="Links at the bottom of a page to get to related content">
      <figcaption class="nhsuk-image__caption">
       Image showing nav structures that support navigation TBC
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <h3>Search</h3>
  <p>Search helps users locate things that are more difficult to find.</p>
  <p>Organising your content and making it easy to navigate is vital for on-site search and helps Google understand it.</p>
     <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
   <p>The work done to document hierarchies and the relationships between content on the NHS website underpin the site search engine and content management system (CMS).</p>
   <figure class="nhsuk-image nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">
      <img class="nhsuk-image__img" src="/assets/search.png" alt="image showing a search bar">
      <figcaption class="nhsuk-image__caption">
        Image of a search bar
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <h3>Placemaking, orientation, navigation and search rely on consistent navigation systems</h3>
  <p>Consistency builds trust. It's also to vital for accessibility.</p>
  <p>Hub pages, breadcrumbs and menus must work together to provide a consistent navigation system across every page of your website. That way all users have access to the structures that let them find what they need, wherever they are on the site.</p>
  <p>Different users use different navigation methods at different times. Your IA needs to give users multiple ways to do the same thing. For example, to go "up" a level, they might use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>page to page navigation</li>
    <li>the back button</li>
  </ul>
    <div class="app-example app-example--content">
    <strong class="nhsuk-tag app-example__heading">Example</strong>
   <p>The NHS website's CMS uses templates for navigational hubs and content pages with page to page navigation. Teams use these templates and the same components and patterns consistently across the site.</p>
