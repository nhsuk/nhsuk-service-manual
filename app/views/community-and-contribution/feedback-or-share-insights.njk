<p>We want to hear how you and your users find things in the service manual. You can do this by taking part in discussions on GitHub.</p>

<h2>1. Find the thing in the backlog</h2>
<p>If the thing you want to comment on is already published in the service manual, you can find a link to the GitHub issue at the bottom of the page about it.</p>
<p>Or you can go directly to GitHub and look in 1 of the 3 project boards in the <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog">NHS design system community backlog</a>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/1">design system (styles, components and patterns) backlog</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/2">content guide backlog</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-community-backlog/projects/3">practices and ways of working backlog</a> â€“ includes Accessibility guidance and the NHS service standard</li>
  </ul>

<p>If the thing has not been published, it may be in the backlog as a proposed item. If it is not in the backlog, you can <a href="/community-and-contribution/propose-component-pattern">propose a component or pattern</a> or other issue yourself.</p>

<p>You can use search to find things.</p>

<h2>2. Leave a comment</h2>
<p>Use the textbox at the bottom of the page to give your feedback or share insights.</p>

</figure>
<p>If you can, please share:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>some information about your service or use case</li>
    <li>your design thinking, with screenshots if you have them</li>
    <li>any research findings you have</li>
  </ul>
<div class="nhsuk-warning-callout">
  <h3 class="nhsuk-warning-callout__label">
    <span role="text">
      <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Important: </span>
     Do not share personal information
    </span>
  </h3>
  <p>Remember that all the information on GitHub is open to the public. Do not share any personally identifiable information about your users or sensitive information about your service.</p>
</div>
<h3>Opening a GitHub account</h3>
<p>If you are not signed into GitHub, you will see a message instead of the textbox, asking you to "sign in to comment".</p>

  <img class="nhsuk-image__img app-image__img" src="/assets/community-backlog-issue-comment-signin-screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of the sign up message">
</figure>
<p>Anyone can open a free GitHub account.</p>
<h2 class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-3">3. Service manual team review</h2>
<p>After you have submitted your comment, the service manual team will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>get a notification from GitHub</li>
  <li>review the issue as part of the weekly service manual community rota</li>
  <li>let you know what action the team will take</li>
</ul>
<p>The service manual team does not usually act immediately on feedback. We sometimes need to see evidence across several teams before we can be sure that something is a problem.</p>
<p>If you have any problems or questions, feel free to <a href="/get-in-touch">get in touch</a>.</p>
