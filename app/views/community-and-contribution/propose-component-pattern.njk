  <h2>How to propose a new thing</h2>
  <h3>Check the backlog</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Check if your idea is already in the <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog">community backlog</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>If the idea has been proposed</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Please add any examples or evidence you have to support the proposal.</li>
    <li>If you'd like to work on it, read <a href="/community-and-contribution/develop-component-pattern">how to work on a new component or pattern.</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>If your idea is not in the backlog</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You can <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/issues/new">raise an issue using the template</a>.</li>
    <li>At this stage, you just need to present your idea and evidence of user needs.</li>
    <li>The service manual team will review your proposal and see if it meets the <a href="/community-and-contribution/contribution-criteria">contribution criteria</a>.</li>
    <li>Once the proposal is ready to be worked on, it will be marked as "To do" in the backlog.</li>
    <li>You can then choose to <a href="/community-and-contribution/develop-component-pattern">work on it yourself</a>, or leave it for someone else.</li>
  </ul>
