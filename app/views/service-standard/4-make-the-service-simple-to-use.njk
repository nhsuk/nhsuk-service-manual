    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>People expect services to just work. They need things to be easy when they're worried or ill. And NHS staff need services that are easy to use so that they can focus on patient care.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>make sure the service helps the user to do what they need to do as simply as possible - so that people succeed first time, with the minimum of help</li>
      <li>test for usability frequently with actual and potential users, using appropriate research techniques</li>
      <li>test all the parts of the service that the user interacts with - online and offline parts (like letters)</li>
      <li>design the service to work online with a range of devices that reflect usersâ€™ behaviour</li>
      <li>make the experience consistent from start to finish by using the <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns">styles, components and patterns</a> and the <a href="/service-manual/content">content style guide</a> in the service manual</li>
    </ul>
