    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>Health is complex. People often do not know how health and care organisations and services fit together. It helps if you can bring things together into a journey which makes sense to users, irrespective of which organisation they "belong" to or the channel they use.</p>

    <p>You may not be able to fix a whole problem, but you may be able to improve it and to support or influence a wider solution.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you understand where the user need you're addressing fits into wider healthcare journeys or how it will join up with other things to solve a whole problem for users</li>
      <li>you make it easy for users to focus on the next step in a journey or in managing their health, helping them get the right help from the right place at the right time</li>
      <li>you are addressing any problems with internal processes, policy or legislation that make it difficult to join things up and to address a whole problem</li>
      <li>you work with front line and admin staff, where appropriate, and invite them and policy people to attend user research and to contribute to decisions</li>
      <li>you research, test and make changes to usersâ€™ experience of online and offline channels (for example, call centre scripts and letters)</li>
      <li>you minimise the number of times users provide the same information to NHS services (while respecting their privacy)</li>
      <li>your service is viable and its scope is based on how users think - not too wide and not too narrow</li>
      <li>you have considered alternatives to creating a service - for example, running a health campaign, partnering with another organisation, or making an API available - or doing nothing</li>
      <li>you have built relationships with other teams and organisations to make your service more effective</li>
      <li>you work in the open so that people outside the organisation know what you are doing, to increase the potential for collaboration and reduce duplication of effort</li>
    </ul>
