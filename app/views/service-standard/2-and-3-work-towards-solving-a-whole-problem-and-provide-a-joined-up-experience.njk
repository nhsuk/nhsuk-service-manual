  <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">Collaborate across team, programme and organisational boundaries and create a service that meets users' needs across all channels.</p>
 {{ insetText({
    "HTML": "<p>In the GOV.UK service standard, these are 2 separate points but our user research showed that it helped digital teams working in health to deal with them together.</p>"

  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>Health is complex. People often do not know how health and care organisations and services fit together. It helps if you can bring things together into a journey which makes sense to users, irrespective of which organisation they "belong" to or the channel they use.</p>

  <p>You may not be able to fix a whole problem, but you may be able to improve it and to support or influence a wider solution.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>understand where the user need you're addressing fits into wider healthcare journeys or how it will join up with other things to solve a whole problem for users</li>
    <li>make it easy for users to focus on the next step in a journey or in managing their health, helping them get the right help from the right place at the right time</li>
    <li>are addressing any problems with internal processes, policy or legislation that make it difficult to join things up and to address a whole problem</li>
    <li>work with front line and admin staff, where appropriate, and invite them and policy people to attend user research and to contribute to decisions</li>
    <li>research, test and make changes to users' experience of online and offline channels (for example, call centre scripts and letters)</li>
    <li>minimise the number of times users provide the same information to NHS services (while respecting their privacy)</li>
    <li>have a viable service with a scope that is based on how users think - not too wide and not too narrow</li>
    <li>have considered alternatives to creating a service - for example, running a health campaign, partnering with another organisation, or making an API available - or doing nothing</li>
    <li>have built relationships with other teams and organisations to make your service more effective</li>
    <li>work in the open so that people outside the organisation know what you are doing, to increase the potential for collaboration and reduce duplication of effort</li>
  </ul>
