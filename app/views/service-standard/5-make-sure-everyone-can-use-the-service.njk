    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>NHS services are for everyone. We have a duty to consider everyone’s needs when we’re designing and delivering services.</p>
    <p>Inclusive, accessible services are better for everyone. For example, using simple words helps people who are sick or stressed as well as people who have a learning disability.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>meet accessibility standards for online and offline parts, including WCAG2.1 AA</li>
      <li>understand who the most vulnerable users for your service are and include them in user research, for example: people with access needs, people with low socio-economic status (D and E), older people, and black and minority ethnic people</li>
      <li>make sure you do not exclude any groups your service serves, for example because they lack digital skills or internet access, and you provide assisted digital support to cover any gaps</li>
      <li>avoid making any groups of people feel excluded</li>
      <li>design for low digital and health literacy</li>
    </ul>
