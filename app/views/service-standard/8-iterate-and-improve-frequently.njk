    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>Services are never ‘finished’. Once you have got real people using your service, you need to iterate and improve it throughout its lifetime.</a>
    <p>That means more than doing basic maintenance, like fixing bugs in code or deploying security patches. It means responding to feedback and changes in user needs and behaviour, clinical evidence and practice, technology and policy.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>continue to research and respond to feedback, data and metrics and the changing context within which you work</li>
      <li>have a process for reviewing all content and checking that it is up to date and reflects the latest clinical evidence, or is retired</li>
      <li>understand where your priorities lie and which improvements will deliver the most value</li>
      <li>have an appropriate level of resource to continue to improve the live service</li>
    </ul>
