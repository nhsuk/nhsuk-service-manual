    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>Digital services are not excluded from the NHS commitment to care and compassion. Small things make a difference when people are, for example, sick or stressed, grieving or dying.</p>
    <p>We can improve people's experience of care by being inclusive and treating them with respect.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>listen to and understand your users' personal, cultural, social and religious needs as well as their care needs</li>
      <li>are respectful and inclusive</li>
      <li>take users' fears and concerns seriously and think carefully about their context and circumstances</li>
      <li>where appropriate, involve people in decisions about their care and respect their right to choose - for example, to book an appointment with a female member of staff or to delay treatment</li>
      <li>balance helping users complete the task with an appropriate tone, reassurance, and clear explanations</li>
      <li>signpost to support to help people cope emotionally</li>
      <li>tell people what will happen next and, where appropriate, keep them informed and involved in the progress of their care and treatment</li>
      <li>use the most appropriate channels, including the phone or face to face contact</li>
    </ul>
