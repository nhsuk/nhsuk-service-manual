    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>A team with diversity of expertise and perspectives is more likely to come up with the best solution. The size and roles you'll need will change as you build the service.</p>

    <p>You will get most value from the broad range of roles recommended by the Government Digital Service.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you are building your service with a multidisciplinary team that will help you achieve what you need to in each phase of development, and you have co-located them as far as possible</li>
      <li>you include people on the team with expertise in how services are delivered across all the relevant channels, and the back end systems the service will need to integrate with</li>
      <li>the team has access to the specialist expertise it needs (for example clinical, legal or policy expertise - from inside or outside the organisation)</li>
      <li>the team you have will help you deal with what you believe are your riskiest assumptions</a>
      <li>if the team is working with contractors and outside suppliers, you make sure it’s on a sustainable basis</li>
    </ul>
