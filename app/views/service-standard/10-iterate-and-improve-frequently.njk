    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>Services are never ‘finished’. Once you have got real people using your service, you need to iterate and improve it throughout its lifetime.</a>
    <p>That means more than doing basic maintenance like fixing bugs in code or deploying security patches. It means responding to feedback and changes in user needs, health evidence, technology and health policy.</p>-

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you continue to research and respond to data and metrics and the changing context within which you work</li>
      <li>you have a process for reviewing all content and checking that it is up to date and reflects the latest health evidence</li>
      <li>you understand where your priorities lie and which improvements will deliver the most value</li>
      <li>you have an appropriate level of resource to continue to improve the live service</li>
    </ul>
