  <h2>The GOV.UK service standard in the context of health</h2>

    <h3 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">1. Understand users and their needs in the context of health and care</h3>
    <p>Take time to understand your users' clinical, practical and emotional needs - and abilities - and the problem you're trying to solve for them.</p>
    <p>Think about people's entire experience and the systems and processes around the product or service you're building.</p>

    <p>Collaborate across team, programme and organisational boundaries and create a service that meets users' needs across all channels.</p>

    <p>Make sure people with different physical, mental health, social, cultural or learning needs can use your service, whether it's for the public or staff.</p>
    <p>And people who do not have access to the internet or lack the skills or confidence to use it.</p>

    <p>Caring is the core business of the NHS. NHS services should provide a positive experience of care or help NHS staff provide a caring service.</p>
    <p>All services should make patients, the public and staff feel valued and supported and, as far as possible, involve people in their own care.</p>

    <h3 id="point6" class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8">16. Make your service clinically safe</h3>

     <h3 id="point12" class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-6">17. Make your service interoperable</h3>
    <p>In an organisation as diverse and complex as the NHS, we need systems and services which talk to each other. Build for interoperability to share patient records and get data quickly from one place to another.</p>
