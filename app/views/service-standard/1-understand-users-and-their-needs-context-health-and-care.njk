    <h2>Why it's important</h2>
    <p>Lots of products and services aren't useful for users. Others are frustrating and hard to use. You need to understand your users and their needs - from their point of view - to build something that helps them.</p>
    <p>The most obvious problem isn't always the one that really needs solving. Test your assumptions early to reduce the risk of building the wrong thing.</p>
    <p>Understanding as much of the context as possible will give you the best chance of meeting users' needs in a simple, cost effective way.</p>

    <h2>What you should do</h2>
    <h3>If you're building a public-facing service</h3>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>you have done user research with the public, patients, their families, carers - and healthcare staff if appropriate - including in their natural environment, such as at home or in a GP surgery</li>
      <li>you've considered your users' knowledge, skills and confidence and whether you can empower them, and give them more control</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>If you're building services for staff</h3>
    <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
    <ul><li>you've done user research with all relevant user groups, including frontline and back office staff</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>You should also be able to show that:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>you have used user research, search data, analytics or other data to understand the problem you need to solve</li>
      <li>you've built quick, throwaway prototypes to test your hypothesis</li>
      <li>your solution works well for users</li>
    </ul>
