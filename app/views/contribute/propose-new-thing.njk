    <h2>How to propose a new thing</h2>
    <h3>Check the backlog</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Check if your idea is already on the <a href="/service-manual/contribute/backlog">community backlog</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>If the idea has been proposed</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Please add any examples or evidence you have to support the proposal.</li>
      <li>If you'd like to work on it, read <a href="">how to work on a new component or pattern.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>If your idea is not in the backlog</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can <a href="">raise an issue using the template</a></li>
      <li>At this stage, you just need to present your idea and evidence of user needs.</li>
      <li>The standards team will review your proposal, and see if it meets all the <a href="">contribution criteria</a>.</li>
      <li>Once the proposal is ready to be worked on, it will be marked as to do in the backlog.</li>
      <li>You can then choose to <a href="">work on it yourself</a>, or leave it for someone else.</li>
    </ul>
