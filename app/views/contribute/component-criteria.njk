    <p>The contents of the service manual must be of a high quality and meet user needs. To guarantee this, the service manual has a design working group to check that all components and patterns meet certain criteria.</p>

    <h2>Criteria for proposals for new components and patterns</h2>
    <p>To be successful, your proposal needs to show that the component or pattern you're suggesting will be useful and unique.</p>

          <li>a month and year only</li>
          <li>a precise date</li>
          <li>any other combination</li>
          </ul>
        <p>The component or pattern has been tested and works with a range of browsers, assistive technologies and devices.</p>

        <td class="nhsuk-table__cell">Clinically safe</td>

          <p>You have asked for feedback from an appropriate clinician and have addressed any clinical safety issues they raised.</p>
          <p>The working group includes a clinician trained in clinical safety. We will ask them to approve the component or pattern from a clinical safety point of view.</p>
          </td>

<p>The working group uses these criteria to decide if the component or pattern is ready to publish.</p>
