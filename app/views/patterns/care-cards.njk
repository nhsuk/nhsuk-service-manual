                <p>Avoid linking to more information about a condition from an emergency care card. If it's an emergency, the important thing is to dial 999 or go to A&amp;E.</p>
                <p>We are still testing the emergency care card. If you have anything to contribute, please contact us on the <a href="https://nhsuk.slack.com/messages/standards">NHSUK #standards Slack channel</a> or email <a href="mailto:service-manual@nhs.net">service-manual@nhs.net</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-8" id="how-to-use-care-cards">How to use care cards</h2>
                    <p>Use care cards to tell users to contact their GP or get medical advice or help. If you want to highlight a key point, use inset text. If you want to warn a user about something, use a <a href="/service-manual/patterns/warning_callout/">warning callout</a> instead.</p>
                    <p>Give the card a heading. It should be a clear call to action, for example "Call 111" or "Speak to a GP". If the card includes more than one call to action, use the format: "Call 111 if:" or "Speak to a GP if:" followed by a bulleted list.</p>
                    <p>Make sure the care card is concise, specific and self-contained. Don't say: "Contact your GP if this happens." Explain in the care card in what circumstances users should contact their GP.</p>
                    <p>Avoid using more than 2 care cards on a page. We want to give essential information and reassure people, not to scare them. Give priority to the care cards over <a href="/service-manual/patterns/warning_callout/">warning callouts</a> or inset text. If you use more than one care card - or a care card and a warning callout, it's best to separate them with at least one paragraph of text.</p>
                    
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>People with visual disabilities may not be able to recognise care cards by their colour. Use clearly worded headings to help them.</p>
                <p>Screen reader users may rely on heading levels or hidden labels to recognise care cards. We are considering heading levels and testing hidden labels to make care cards meaningful for screen reader users.
