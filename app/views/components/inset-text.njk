  <h2>When to use inset text</h2>
  <p>Use inset text for content that needs to stand out from the rest of the page.</p>

  <h2 id="when-not-to-use-inset-text">When not to use inset text</h2>
  <p>Do not use inset text in transactional pages. We haven't tested it there yet.</p>
  <p>Do not use inset text if you need to tell a user to contact their GP or get medical help. Use a <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/care-cards">care card</a> instead.</p>
  <p>Some users don't notice inset text on complex pages or near to other prominent elements, so we avoid using it for very important information that users need to see. Use a <a href="/service-manual/styles-components-patterns/warning-callout">warning callout</a> instead if the information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>is time critical</li>
    <li>could have a significant effect on someone's health</li>
    <li>addresses a common or significant misconception or mistake</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-to-use-inset-text">How to use inset text</h2>
  <p>Don't overdo inset text. Think about whether you need it and the best place to put it.</p>

  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
  <p>People with visual disabilities may not be able to see the colour that marks out inset text. Instead they may rely on hidden labels to recognise it.</p>
  <p class="rich-text">We use <code>&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Information: &lt;/span&gt;</code> to let users with screen readers know that this is different to the body text.</p>

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
  <p>We've tested inset text in content pages and users understood its purpose. We haven't tested inset text in transactional pages.</p>
