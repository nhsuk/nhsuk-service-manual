  <h2>New proposals</h2>

  <p>To be successful, proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would be useful and unique.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/service-manual/community/working-group">working group</a> will look at proposals in the <a href="/service-manual/community/backlog">community backlog</a> to check that they meet these criteria before moving them to the "To do" column.</p>

  <h2>Before a component or pattern is published</h2>

  <p>The working group reviews the implementation to make sure it is usable, consistent and versatile.</p>

          <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0">The component or pattern must also have been tested and shown to work with a range of <a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/contributing/browser-support.md">browsers, assistive technologies and devices</a>.</p>
