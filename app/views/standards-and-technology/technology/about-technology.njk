  <p>Using common tools and technologies across health and care will help:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>improve user journeys</li>
    <li>make sure services comply with national standards</li>
    <li>reduce the cost of building new products and services</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Approval of common tools</h2>
  <p>The System Design Authority (SDA) approves inclusion of common tools in the service manual. It has approved the above tools so far.</p>

  <p>For a technology or tool to be added to <a href="/standards-and-technology/service-standard-points/11-choose-the-right-tools-and-technology">section 11 of the NHS digital service standard</a> it must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>have a clear onboarding process for integration into a product or service</li>
    <li>be well documented, including support information for developers and users</li>
    <li>have a transparent and robust assurance process</li>
    <li>support national standards</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We're very interested in hearing what you think about the standards and technology section of the service manual and how it might, or might not, help you develop digital services in health.</p>
