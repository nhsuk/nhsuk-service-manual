<h2>What is PDS?</h2>
<p>The Personal Demographics Service (PDS) is a national database of NHS patient details such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>NHS number</li>
  <li>name</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>related people</li>
  <li>registered GP</li>
</ul>
<p>It helps healthcare professionals identify patients and match them to their health records. It also allows them to contact and communicate with patients. It supports information standard <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/isb-0149-nhs-number">ISB 0149 NHS number (on NHS Digital's website)</a>.</p>

<h2>When to use PDS</h2>

<p>Use PDS when you need to know the NHS number of a patient, and to find and use personal demographic details, for example to contact them. To use this data there are 2 APIs available:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir">PDS FHIR API (NHS Digital)</a>: the preferred API which meets the latest standards</li>
  <li><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-hl7-v3">PDS HL7 V3 API (NHS Digital)</a>: use it to create new records or register a birth</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-smsp">PDS Spine Mini Service Provider (SMSP) API (NHS Digital)</a> is now deprecated. <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-smsp#api-status">Read more about this API's status on the SMSP page.</a></p>

<h2>When not to use PDS</h2>
<p>You cannot use the PDS FHIR API to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>create a new record for a birth</li>
  <li>register a birth</li>
  <li>create a record for a new patient</li>
  <li>register a new patient at a GP practice: use <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/nhais-gp-links">National Health Application and Infrastructure Services (NHAIS) (NHS Digital)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Keep up to date with product developments through <a href="https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=allexceptdone&tag=pds-fhir-api">NHS Digital's API roadmap and interactive backlog for PDS FHIR API</a>.</p>

<h2>Why it's important</h2>
<p>The PDS service:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provides a consistent service by updating demographic information in one place</li>
  <li>lets health professionals identify and match patients to their health records and check the accuracy of patient data held locally</li>
  <li>enables patient information to be shared safely within and across organisational boundaries including for referrals, prescriptions and social care</li>
  <li>reduces the amount of patient data held locally, which supports the information governance principle of data minimisation, and improves data quality</li>
  <li>has a range of features to maintain and manage data, saving establishing expensive and resource intensive data management tools locally</li>
</ul>
