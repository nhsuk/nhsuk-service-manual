  <p>The NHS service standard is designed to help teams:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>meet the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">GOV.UK service standard</a></li>
    <li>address the different needs of health service users</li>
    <li>navigate the complexities of delivering digital services in health and care</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It contains the 14 points of the GOV.UK service standard, with guidance to help teams meet them in a health context, and <a href="#3-points-specific-to-health-and-social-care">3 extra points specific to health and social care</a>.</p>
  <p>If your service is being assessed by the Government Digital Service, you must meet the first 14 points. If you work in health, we recommend trying to meet all 17 points.</p>
