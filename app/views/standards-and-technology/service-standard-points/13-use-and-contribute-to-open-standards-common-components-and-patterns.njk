  <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">Use tried and tested components and patterns from the <a href="/design-system/components">NHS digital service manual</a> or, failing that, the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a>.</p>

  <p class="nhsuk-lede-text app-lede-text">Use open standards, and propose a new open standard if there is not one that already meets your needs.</p>

  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>Using common components and patterns means you do not have to solve problems that have already been solved. By using a component or pattern that’s already been extensively tested, you can provide users with a good experience in a cost effective way.</p>
  <p>If you develop your own components or patterns, it’s important to share them so that others can benefit from your work.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>build on common NHS styles, patterns and components</li>
    <li>share details of any new components or patterns you create or adapt (for example, by contributing to the service manual)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For more on open standards, see point <a href="/standards-and-technology/service-standard-points/17-make-your-service-interoperable">17: Make your service interoperable</a>.</p>
