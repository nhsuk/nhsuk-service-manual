  <p class="nhsuk-lede-text">Build on open standards and common components and patterns.</p>

  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>Using common components and patterns from the <a href="/design-system">NHS design system</a> or, failing that, the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> means you do not have to solve problems that have already been solved. By using a component or pattern that’s already been extensively tested, you can provide users with a good experience in a cost effective way.</p>
  <p>If you develop your own components or patterns, it's important to share them so that others can benefit from your work.</p>
  <p>Open standards help services to work consistently, so you'll spend less time trying to make systems "talk" to each other. And they help you to avoid getting locked into a particular supplier or technology so when things change, you can change your approach.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>build on common NHS styles, patterns and components</li>
    <li>share details of any new components or patterns you create or adapt (for example, by contributing to the service manual)</li>
    <li>use open standards, and propose a new open standard if there is not one that already meets your needs</li>
    <li>if you create any data sets that could be useful to others, publish them in an open machine-readable format, under an Open Government Licence, unless they contain personally identifiable information, sensitive information, or where publishing the data would infringe the intellectual property rights of someone outside the NHS or government</li>
  </ul>
