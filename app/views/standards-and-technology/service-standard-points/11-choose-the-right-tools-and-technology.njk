  <p class="nhsuk-lede-text app-lede-text">Build a sustainable service which allows you to change direction in future.</p>

  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>When you make a decision about technology, you're making a significant investment. The choices you make will have a huge impact on your ability to create, iterate and operate the service in a flexible, sustainable way.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>When considering technical architecture, choice of programming languages, development toolchain and other technology choices, your team should be able to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use appropriate tools and technologies to create and operate a good service in a cost effective way - for example, by automating things where possible</li>
    <li>use HTML5 by default</li>
    <li>have made good decisions about what technology to reuse or build and what to buy</li>
    <li>understand tech decisions that have been made outside your team and challenge these decisions where it will improve the service</li>
    <li>understand total cost of ownership of the technology and have kept the ability to make different choices in future - for example, reducing the chances of getting locked into contracts for specific tools and suppliers by using open standards</li>
    <li>use standard NHS technology components where possible, for example: the <a href="/standards-and-technology/technology/NHS-login">NHS login</a> to authenticate identity and the <a href="/standards-and-technology/technology/personal-demographics-service-PDS">Personal Demographics Service (PDS)</a> to manage patient demographic data</li>
    <li>have an effective approach to managing any legacy technology the service integrates with or depends on</li>
  </ul>
