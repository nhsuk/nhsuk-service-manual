  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>Connected systems make it easier for the public and health professionals to access and share the information they need. Interoperability helps make sure that data is communicated accurately and quickly and that patients get seamless care.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>you follow this standard for interoperability you build and maintain yourself and require your suppliers to follow it</li>
    <li>you follow the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-policies-and-best-practice">API policies and best practice (NHS Digital)</a></li>
    <li>you use agreed <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue?filter=fhir">FHIR-based APIs (from NHS Digital's API catalogue, filtered by FHIR)</a> to join up care for patients</li>
    <li>you use FHIR UK Core when building new APIs or migrating old APIs, for example to add significant new functionality</li>
    <li>you keep pace with national API and interoperability standards changes</li>
    <li>your APIs use structured data by default, HTML 5 optionally and no PDFs</li>
    <li>you use synchronous REST APIs by default</li>
    <li>if you present information to users in a specific format, you (not the system that sent the data) are responsible for this</li>
    <li>you check the <a href="https://standards.nhs.uk/">NHS standards directory</a> for relevant standards</li>
    <li>where appropriate, you use the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/isb-0149-nhs-number">NHS number (NHS Digital)</a> to identify patients on APIs</li>
    <li>for disease information in mortality and morbidity statistics, you use <a href="https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en">ICD-10 (the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases, version 10)</a></li>
    <li>for electronic care records, you use the structured clinical vocabulary <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/terminology-and-classifications/snomed-ct">SNOMED CT (NHS Digital)</a></li>
  </ul>
