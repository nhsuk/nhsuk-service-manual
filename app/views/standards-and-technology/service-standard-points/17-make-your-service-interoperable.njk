  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>Connected systems make it easier for the public and health professionals to access and share the information they need. Interoperability helps make sure that data is communicated accurately and quickly and that patients get seamless care.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>you work to open standards and the Technology Code of Practice</li>
    <li>you have checked the <a href="https://data.standards.nhs.uk/">NHS data standards directory</a> for relevant standards</li>
    <li>you maximise flexibility and make content, tools and services available to more people through well-designed APIs, following the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-policies-and-best-practice">API policies and best practice (NHS Digital)</a></li>
    <li>you use agreed <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue?filter=fhir">FHIR-based APIs (from NHS Digital's API catalogue, filtered by FHIR)</a> to join up care for patients</li>
    <li>where appropriate, you use the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/isb-0149-nhs-number">NHS number (NHS Digital)</a> and NHS data registers and comply with NHS clinical information standards</li>
    <li>for disease information in mortality and morbidity statistics, you use <a href="https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en">ICD-10 (the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases, version 10)</a></li>
    <li>for electronic care records, you use the structured clinical vocabulary <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/terminology-and-classifications/snomed-ct">SNOMED CT (NHS Digital)</a></li>
    <li>if you create any data sets that could be useful to others, you publish them in an open machine-readable format, under an <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government Licence</a>, unless they contain personally identifiable information, sensitive information, or where publishing the data would infringe the intellectual property rights of someone outside the NHS or government</li>
    <li>if you use barcodes or similar identifiers, you comply with the <a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/barcodes">GS1 barcodes standard</a> as set out in <a href="https://www.scan4safety.nhs.uk/">Scan4Safety</a></li>
    <li>where relevant, you comply with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government">standards published by the Open Standards Board (GOV.UK)</a></li>
  </ul>
