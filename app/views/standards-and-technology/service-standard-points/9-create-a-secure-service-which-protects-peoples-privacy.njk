  <p class="nhsuk-lede-text app-lede-text">Understand how to manage risks throughout the delivery lifecycle and put robust security measures in place to protect against potential threats.</p>

  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>The NHS handles some of the most sensitive personal data. It has a legal duty to protect this information. Failing to do so would undermine public trust in the health service. </p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>follow the <a href="https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/secure-by-design/principles/">Secure by design principles on the Government Security website</a></li>
    <li>make sure senior leaders who are accountable for security are aware of risks</li>
    <li>have a plan and budget to manage security during the life of the service, including responding to changes in requirements or new threats</li>
    <li>perform due diligence on the security of third-party software</li>  
    <li>carry out user research to create security processes that are fit for purpose and easy to understand</li>
    <li>collect, process and store data securely and in a way which respects people's privacy</li>  
    <li>maintain an assessment of security risks and mitigate threats with appropriate protections</li>
    <li>work with business and information risk teams to make sure the service meets security requirements and manages fraud risks</li>
    <li>anticipate and manage vulnerabilities, limiting opportunities for cyber attacks</li>
    <li>regularly test security controls</li>
    <li>are aware of and, if appropriate, comply with NHS specific guidance on data security and information governance</li>
    <li>use the NHS login and NHS identity programme, if your service needs identity assurance and authentication</li>
    <li>allow for a full range of privacy preferences so people can control how much information they give and share</li>
    <li>make it easy for users to actively make informed decisions about privacy settings, update their settings and track any changes (for example, by carers or other people who have access to their records)</li>
    <li>if appropriate, undertake a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) and publish a privacy policy</li>
    <li>have processes in place to protect the public and NHS staff, for example, if you manage user-generated content</li>
  </ul>
