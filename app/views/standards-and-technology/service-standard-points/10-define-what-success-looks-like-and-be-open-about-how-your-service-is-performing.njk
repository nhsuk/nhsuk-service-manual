  <p class="nhsuk-lede-text app-lede-text">Collect performance information across all channels so that you can measure and show that the service is effective and improving.</p>

  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>Having clear objectives, a definition of what success looks like and appropriate metrics means that you'll know whether the service is solving the problem it's meant to solve.</p>
  <p>Collecting the right information will alert you to improvements you need to make and help you know if changes have the effect you intend.</p>
  <p>Services funded by public money should be transparent about how they are performing.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>are clear from the start what your objectives are and the benefits you will be measuring</li>
    <li>have a benefits case that considers not just the cost but also use, usability and clinical benefit</li>
    <li>have identified appropriate metrics and are tracking performance against them</li>
    <li>identify not only the benefits but also potential negative impact, inappropriate use or unintended consequences</li>
    <li>use performance data to make decisions about how to fix problems and improve the service</li>
    <li>iterate and improve your metrics and data collection practices as you learn more about user needs</li>
    <li>make performance information public</li>
  </ul>
