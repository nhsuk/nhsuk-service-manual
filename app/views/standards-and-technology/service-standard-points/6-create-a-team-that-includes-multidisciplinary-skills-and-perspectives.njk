  <p class="nhsuk-lede-text app-lede-text">Make as many decisions as possible in the team so that you can respond quickly to what you learn about users and their needs.</p>

  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>A team with diversity of expertise and perspectives is more likely to come up with the best solution. The size and roles you'll need will change as you build the service.</p>

  <p>You will get most value from the broad range of roles recommended by the Government Digital Service.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>You should be able to show that your team:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>is a multidisciplinary team that will help you achieve what you need to in each phase of development</li>
    <li>is co-located as far as possible</li>
    <li>includes people with expertise in how services are delivered across all the relevant channels, and the back end systems the service will need to integrate with</li>
    <li>has access to the specialist expertise it needs (for example clinical, legal or policy expertise, from inside or outside the organisation)</li>
    <li>will help you deal with what you believe are your riskiest assumptions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the team is working with contractors and outside suppliers, you must make sure it's on a sustainable basis.</p>
