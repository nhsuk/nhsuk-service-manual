  <p class="nhsuk-lede-text app-lede-text">Services should make patients, the public and staff feel included, valued, safe and supported. As far as possible, involve people in their own care.</p>

  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>Digital services must meet the NHS commitment to care and compassion. Small things make a difference when people are, for example, sick or stressed, grieving or dying.</p>
  <p>We can improve people's experience of care by being inclusive and treating them with respect.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>listen to and understand your users' personal, cultural, social and religious needs as well as their care needs</li>
    <li>are respectful and inclusive</li>
    <li>take users' fears, concerns and emotional state seriously and consider their circumstances, including any trauma they may have experienced, so you can meet their needs better</li>
    <li>consider both positive and negative scenarios for your service, including whether it could be used to control or abuse someone</li>
    <li>where appropriate, involve people in decisions about their care and respect their right to choose – for example, to book an appointment with a female member of staff or to delay treatment</li>
    <li>balance helping users complete the task with an appropriate tone, reassurance, and clear explanations</li>
    <li>signpost to emotional and practical support</li>
    <li>tell people what will happen next and, where appropriate, keep them informed and involved in the progress of their care and treatment</li>
    <li>use the most appropriate channels, including the phone or face to face contact</li>
  </ul>
