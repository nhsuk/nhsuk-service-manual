  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>The public, patients and staff need to access NHS services throughout the day and night. If a service is unavailable or slow, it can mean people do not get the help they need.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>maximise uptime and speed of response for the online part of the service</li>
    <li>deploy software changes regularly, without significant downtime</li>
    <li>carry out quality assurance testing regularly</li>
    <li>test the service in an environment that's as similar to live as possible</li>
    <li>have appropriate monitoring in place, together with a proportionate, sustainable plan to respond to problems identified by monitoring (given the impact of problems on users and on the NHS)</li>
    <li>actively work towards fixing any organisational or contractual issues which make it difficult to maximise availability (for example, by agreeing a common set of languages, tools, and ways of working for technical staff)</li>
    </ul>
