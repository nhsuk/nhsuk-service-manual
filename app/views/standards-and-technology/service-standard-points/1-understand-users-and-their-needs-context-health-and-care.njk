  <p class="nhsuk-lede-text app-lede-text">Think about people's entire experience and the systems and processes around the product or service you're building.</p>

  <h2>Why it's important</h2>
  <p>Lots of products and services are not useful for users. Others are frustrating and hard to use. You need to understand your users and their needs - from their point of view - to build something that helps them.</p>
  <p>Understanding as much of the context as possible will give you the best chance of meeting users' needs in a simple, cost effective way.</p>
  <p>The most obvious problem is not always the one that really needs solving. Test your assumptions early and often to reduce the risk of building the wrong thing.</p>

  <h2>What you should do</h2>
  <h3>If you're building a public-facing service</h3>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>done user research with the public, patients, their families, carers, advocates and representatives - and healthcare staff if appropriate - including in their natural environment, such as at home or in a GP surgery</li>
    <li>considered your users' knowledge, skills, confidence and circumstances, and whether you can empower them and give them more control</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>If you're building services for staff</h3>
  <p>Your team should be able to show that you have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>done user research with all relevant user groups, including frontline and back office staff</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>In both cases</h3>
  <p>You should also be able to show that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>have used user research, search data, analytics or other data to understand the problem you need to solve</li>
    <li>have built quick, throwaway prototypes to test your hypothesis</li>
    <li>your solution works well for users</li>
  </ul>
