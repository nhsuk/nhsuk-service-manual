# NHS digital service manual

Guidance for designing and building digital services for the NHS. Things you need to make consistent, usable services that put people first.

## Running the application locally

### Prerequisite

Install the long-term support (LTS) version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, which includes npm.

### Cloning and running the application

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual.git nhsuk-service-manual` and while in the project directory `cd nhsuk-service-manual`, install the required npm packages with: `npm install`.

Run the project in development mode `npm run watch` and visit <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.

## Running the application via the browser with Gitpod

Before running Gitpod, you must <a href="https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io/installations/new">install the Gitpod.io application on your GitHub account</a>.

Gitpod also requires access to public repositories. Enable this via <a href="https://gitpod.io/integrations">Gitpod integrations</a>. (Click on the 3 dots to edit permissions for your GitHub account. Gitpod may pre-select permissions. You need read/write access to code in the repos.)

Using your own Github credentials you can create, change, commit and push to branches on our Gitpod container via the "ready to code" button below.
